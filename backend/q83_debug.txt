1216: 'Option C is correct. This scenario is based on Adler v George. The Golden Rule is a modification of the literal rule. It is used when the literal meaning would result in an absurdity that Parliament could not possibly have intended. By interpreting "in the vicinity" to include "inside," the court prevented a nonsensical outcome. Therefore, options A,B. D and E are incorrect.'
