SQE 1 Tips & Tricks to Help You Pass
Know the key timeframes and deadlines cold
 Limitation periods, appeal windows, notice requirements, and procedural deadlines are easy marks, but only if you’ve memorised them.

Treat the exam like a race against the clock
 You have roughly 70 seconds per question. Anything slower puts pressure on later questions.

Train with a speed reader
 Practising questions using a speed-reading tool helps condition your brain to extract facts quickly and decisively.

Don’t default to the “reasonable man” option
 It’s a classic distractor. Only choose it if you are certain it correctly applies to the specific legal test in question.

Memorise accounting entries as a daily mantra
 Repetition works. If you can recite comprehensive accounting entries daily, solicitor accounting rules will stick.

Assume every word in the question matters
 SQE questions are carefully engineered, small factual details often flip the correct answer.

Read the call of the question first
 Know exactly what you’re being asked before diving into the scenario.

Avoid overthinking
 Many candidates report changing correct answers because they assumed the exam was “trying to trick them.”

Trust your first instinct (unless you misread)
 Statistically, first answers are often right, second guesses usually come from panic, not logic.

Eliminate wrong answers aggressively
 Often two options are clearly wrong. Narrowing to two dramatically increases accuracy.

Expect crossover questions
 SQE 1 loves blending topics (e.g. contract + professional conduct). Don’t compartmentalise your thinking.

Professional Conduct is everywhere
 Candidates consistently say ethics pops up in unexpected questions, always scan for conduct issues.

Don’t rely on “real-world logic”
 Answer according to the law, not what feels fair or commercially sensible.

Practice under exam conditions
 Online exam fatigue is real. Simulate full-length sittings to build stamina.

Build endurance, not just knowledge
 Many candidates say SQE 1 is as much an endurance exam as a knowledge test.

Eat breakfast on exam day
 Low blood sugar = slower thinking. Candidates who skipped breakfast often regretted it.

Get a proper night’s sleep the day before
 Cramming late hurts more than it helps. Mental sharpness beats last-minute revision.


Know the exam interface in advance
 Familiarity with navigation, flagging, and timing reduces anxiety on the day.

Don’t spend too long on one question
 If you’re stuck, flag it and move on. Time lost is rarely recovered.

Learn common SQE “patterns”
 Repeated fact patterns appear across sittings, recognising them saves time.

Revise from questions, not just notes
 Candidates consistently say improvement came after heavy question practice.

Be precise with terminology
 SQE answers often turn on a single legal term being used correctly.

Watch for absolute language
 Words like always, never, or automatically are often red flags.

Don’t assume the longest answer is correct
 Concise answers are frequently the right ones.

Know when the law requires certainty vs discretion
 Many wrong answers misstate whether a rule is mandatory or optional.

Stay calm if the exam feels hard
 Almost everyone reports thinking “this is awful”, it’s normal and not a sign you’re failing.

Consistency beats intensity
 Candidates who passed often say steady daily revision outperformed last-minute cramming.
