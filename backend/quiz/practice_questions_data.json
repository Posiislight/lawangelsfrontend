The government introduces a Bill titled the Royal Assent Act 2024, promoted by the Lord Chancellor, Michael, as a purely procedural reform reflecting the reality that Royal Assent is now a formality. The Bill provides that once legislation has passed through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, it will automatically become law upon the issue of a certificate signed by the Speakers of both Houses. The Bill expressly states that no signification of Royal Assent by the Monarch will be required. During committee scrutiny, several MPs raise concerns that Royal Assent is a fundamental constitutional requirement and question whether Parliament even has the legal authority to abolish it. Jonathan is asked to advise on the constitutional consequence if the Act were passed and received Royal Assent in the usual manner. What would be the constitutional consequence of this Act if it were passed and given Royal Assent in the usual way?",

He appealed against his sentence to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) on the grounds that it was manifestly excessive. The Court of Appeal heard the case, but the judges dismissed the appeal, upholding the original sentence. Peter’s solicitor, Sarah, believes the Court of Appeal made a significant error of law regarding the interpretation of sentencing guidelines that could affect many other cases. Peter now wishes to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court. Can Peter appeal to the Supreme Court?",

She pays the correct amount of tax calculated. The Land Registry application, including the SDLT5 certificate, is submitted well within the 30-working-day priority period.

SDLT is calculated on the total consideration, which includes any VAT payable, unless the transaction qualifies for VAT zero-rating or exemption. Here, it is standard-rated, so SDLT is due on £2,400,000. Option A is incorrect because the seller's option to tax makes the sale taxable, not exempt. Option C is incorrect because SDLT is based on the VAT-inclusive price for standard-rated supplies; there is no such reduction for providing a VAT number. Option D is incorrect because the sal...",
