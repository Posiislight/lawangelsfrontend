MOCK 3 

Question 1 (BUSINESS LAW)

In the 2024/25 tax year, Chloe sells a painting and realises a chargeable gain of £15,000. She has no other gains or losses in the year. The Annual Exempt Amount for CGT is £3,000.
What is the amount of Chloe’s net taxable gain for the year?
A. £0
B. £3,000
C. £12,000
D. £15,000
E. £18,000
C is the correct option.
Explanation
C is correct. The Annual Exempt Amount is deducted from the total gains for the year to find the net taxable gain. Therefore, £15,000 (total gain) - £3,000 (Annual Exempt Amount) = £12,000 net taxable gain.
A is incorrect as the gain exceeds the Annual Exempt Amount.
B is incorrect as this is the amount of the Annual Exempt Amount itself, not the taxable gain.
D is incorrect as this is the gross gain before applying the Annual Exempt Amount.
E is incorrect as it adds the allowance to the gain.

Question 2 (CONTRACT)
Chloe, a construction contractor, agrees to build a new garden wall for her neighbour, Ethan, for a fixed price of £1,500. Halfway through the job, Chloe tells Ethan that she underestimated the cost of materials and will stop work unless Ethan promises to pay an extra £300. 
Ethan, whose housewarming party is scheduled for the following week, agrees to pay the extra £300 because he urgently needs the wall completed on time to secure a certificate of completion from the local council. Chloe completes the wall on time, but Ethan refuses to pay the extra £300, arguing there was no consideration for his promise.
Is Ethan’s promise to pay the extra £300 legally enforceable?
A. No, because Chloe performed an existing contractual duty, which is not valid consideration.
B. Yes, because Ethan received a benefit by securing the timely completion of the wall.
C. No, because the promise to pay more was made under economic duress.
D. Yes, but only if the agreement to vary the price was executed as a deed.
E. No, because the extra £300 was not requested by Ethan.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Although Chloe was only performing an existing contractual duty (to complete the wall), the principle established in Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd applies. Ethan obtained a practical benefit from his promise to pay the extra £300—securing the timely completion required to obtain his certificate of completion and avoid disruption to his party. This practical benefit constitutes sufficient consideration to make Ethan's promise legally enforceable, provided there was no duress (which is not clearly present here).
Option A is incorrect. This reflects the traditional rule (Stilk v Myrick) but ignores the practical benefit exception.
Option C is incorrect. While duress can void the promise, the facts primarily support a finding of practical benefit, not necessarily the high threshold for economic duress.
Option D is incorrect. A variation does not need to be a deed if fresh consideration (such as the practical benefit) exists.
Option E is incorrect. Consideration only needs to be provided by the promisee (Chloe), not necessarily requested by the promisor (Ethan).
Question 3 (Dispute resolution)
Sarah is the defendant in a breach of contract claim brought by David. David applies for summary judgment. Sarah's Defence relies on a single email that she claims provides conclusive evidence of a binding prior agreement that fundamentally alters the terms of the written contract relied upon by David. David’s solicitor argues that the email is ambiguous and contradictory and that no judge could reasonably accept Sarah's interpretation of it.
What is the single most important test the court must apply when determining David's application for summary judgment?
A.Whether David’s claim can be proven on a balance of probability
B.Whether Sarah's Defence has a real prospect of succeeding at trial.
C. Whether David's claim has a reasonable prospect of being successful.
D. Whether the matter can be properly dealt with at an application hearing.
E. Whether Sarah has provided an undertaking in damages to the court.
The correct option is B.

Explanation
Option B is correct. Under CPR 24.2, the court may give summary judgment if: (a) the claimant has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim or issue; or (b) the defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim or issue; AND (c) there is no other compelling reason why the case should be disposed of at trial. The key assessment is whether the defence has a real prospect (meaning realistic, not merely fanciful) of success. If the court finds that the single email, even if ambiguous, raises a triable issue of fact or law, the application will fail. Therefore, Option A and D are incorrect. 
Option C is incorrect. The application is against the Defence; the relevant test is the prospect of success for the Defence.
Option E is incorrect. An undertaking in damages is relevant to interim injunctions, not summary judgment.
Question 4 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
A government department, acting under statutory powers, negligently designs a highway, causing a severe accident. The injured parties wish to sue for damages. The department argues that, as part of the Crown, it enjoys common law immunity from suit in tort.
What is the correct modern legal position regarding this claim?
A. The claim cannot proceed, as Crown immunity in tort is absolute.
B. The claim can proceed without issue, as the Crown is fully liable for the torts of its servants .
C. The claim can only proceed if the minister responsible is named as the defendant.
D. The claim can proceed, but only if the injured parties first obtain the Attorney General's permission.
E. The claim cannot proceed in tort but could be framed as a breach of statutory duty.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 (s.2(1)) abolished the general common law immunity of the Crown in tort. It provides that the Crown shall be subject to the same tortious liabilities as a private person of full age and capacity. The Crown (sued as “His Majesty’s Government” or the specific department) is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed in the course of their employment, just as any other employer would be.
Option A is incorrect. The 1947 Act specifically removed this absolute immunity for most torts.
Option C is incorrect. While historically suits were against a named minister, the 1947 Act allows the Crown itself to be sued directly.
Option D is incorrect. There is no requirement for the Attorney General's permission to sue the Crown in tort under the 1947 Act.
Option E is incorrect. There is no need to reframe the action; a straightforward claim in negligence can be brought against the Crown directly.

Question 5 (LEGAL SERVICES)
Grace, a solicitor, has successfully made a Suspicious Activity Report to her firm's MLRO regarding her client, James, who is suspected of money laundering during a property purchase. The MLRO has advised Grace that they have obtained consent from the NCA to proceed with the transaction. James calls Grace and asks why the transaction was delayed. Grace replies, "There was a necessary internal compliance check which has now been resolved, and we have received regulatory clearance to proceed."
Has Grace committed the offence of Tipping Off under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA)?
A. Yes, because she mentioned the word 'regulatory' in her communication with James.
B. No, because James was already aware of his own money laundering activities.
C. Yes, because she revealed that an internal check was conducted due to compliance issues.
D. No, because she only communicated the resolution and did not mention the SAR or investigation.
E. Yes, because the offence is committed if the client infers that a SAR has been made.
The correct option is D.
Explanation
Option D is correct. The offence of Tipping Off (POCA s.333) is committed if a person discloses that a SAR has been made, or that a money laundering investigation is underway or imminent, and the disclosure is likely to prejudice the investigation. Grace's response ("necessary internal compliance check... received regulatory clearance") is a carefully worded, neutral explanation that avoids disclosing the existence of the SAR or the investigation, thus generally falling within the SRA's recommended safe harbour for communication.
Option A is incorrect. Using general terms like 'regulatory' or 'compliance' is usually permissible in POCA guidance.
Option B is incorrect. The client's awareness of their own activities is irrelevant to the solicitor's duty not to tip off.
Option C is incorrect. The SRA guidance allows solicitors to give neutral, non-prejudicial explanations for delays.
Option E is incorrect. The offence is based on the disclosure of information that is likely to prejudice the investigation, not merely a client's speculative inference.
Question 6 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
The Scottish Parliament passes a Bill that seeks to introduce a new regulatory framework for local environmental protection. The UK Government believes this Bill might accidentally interfere with international trade agreements. The UK Parliament subsequently passes an Act that explicitly overrides the Scottish Bill to ensure national compliance with trade treaties.
Which of the following best describes the constitutional validity of the UK Parliament’s action?
A.The Act is invalid because the Sewel Convention prevents Westminster from legislating on environmental matters. 
B. The Act is valid because the UK Parliament remains legally sovereign and can legislate on any matter, even if it is devolved.
C. The Act is invalid unless the Scottish Parliament passes a Legislative Consent Motion. 
D. The Act is valid only if the Supreme Court issues a declaration that the Scottish Bill was "ultra vires." 
E.The Act is invalid because the Scotland Act 1998 transferred absolute sovereignty over environmental matters to Scotland.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under the principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty, the UK Parliament has the legal power to make or unmake any law. Although the Sewel Convention states Westminster will "not normally" legislate on devolved matters, the Supreme Court (Miller 1) clarified that this is a political rule, not a legal one that limits Westminster’s legislative competence. 
Option A and C are incorrect. Conventions are politically binding but not legally enforceable in court to invalidate an Act of Parliament. 
Option D is incorrect. Westminster does not need a court ruling to exercise its own legislative sovereignty. 
Option E is incorrect. Devolution is the delegation of power, not the transfer of sovereignty; Westminster retains the power to override devolved legislation.

Question 7 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
The UK Parliament at Westminster is debating the "UK Environmental Standards Act 2024," which sets new binding targets for river water quality. This is a devolved matter in Wales. The Senedd passes a resolution formally withholding a Legislative Consent Motion (LCM) for the bill. Despite this, the UK Government proceeds, and the bill is passed by Westminster and receives Royal Assent.
What is the constitutional status of the UK Environmental Standards Act 2024 in relation to Wales?
A. It is of no legal effect in Wales due to the Senedd's refusal of consent.
B. It is legally valid and applies in Wales, as the UK Parliament retains full legislative sovereignty.
C. It is invalid unless subsequently approved in a Welsh referendum.
D. It applies in Wales, but only to the extent it does not conflict with any existing Senedd legislation.
E. It is suspended until such time as the Senedd grants an LCM.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. The foundational principle of the UK constitution is the sovereignty of the UK Parliament. It can legislate on any matter, for any part of the UK. The Sewel Convention—that Westminster will "not normally" legislate in devolved areas without consent—is a political self-restraint (confirmed in Miller I). A breach of the convention is a political issue, not a legal one. The Act, having passed both Houses and received Royal Assent, is legally valid and applies to Wales.
Option A is incorrect. This would imply a transfer of sovereignty, which has not occurred. The devolution statutes explicitly preserve the power of Westminster to legislate (e.g., Scotland Act 1998, s.28(7)).
Option C is incorrect. There is no constitutional requirement for a referendum in these circumstances.
Option D is incorrect. The doctrine of implied repeal applies. Where a later UK Act conflicts with an earlier Senedd Act, the later UK Act prevails because it is an expression of sovereign parliamentary will.
Option E is incorrect. There is no legal mechanism for the suspension of a valid Act of Parliament based on a devolved legislature's objection.

Question 8  (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)

The Prime Minister advises the King to dissolve Parliament, triggering a general election. A group of citizens applies for judicial review, arguing that the timing of the dissolution is politically motivated and unfairly advantages the governing party. They seek an injunction to prevent the dissolution.
What is the most likely outcome of this application?
A. The court will grant the injunction, as it has jurisdiction to review the fairness of electoral timing.
B. The court will refuse the application, as the dissolution of Parliament is a prerogative power exercised on ministerial advice and is non-justiciable.
C. The court will grant a declaration that the advice was unlawful but cannot injunct the monarch.
D. The court will require the Prime Minister to justify the timing to a parliamentary committee first.
E. The court will delay its decision until after the election has taken place.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. The decision to dissolve Parliament (under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, which revived the prerogative power) is a high-level political prerogative exercised by the monarch on the Prime Minister's advice. Following the principle of non-justiciability established in cases like Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the State for the Civil Service (GCHQ), such matters of high policy are generally not subject to judicial review. The courts treat them as unsuitable for adjudication.
Option A is incorrect. While courts can review some prerogative powers, those relating to the heart of the constitutional relationship between executive and legislature are typically beyond review.
Option C is incorrect. A court would be highly unlikely to make a declaration on the lawfulness of the advice, as the underlying power is non-justiciable. Furthermore, the focus is on the justiciability of the act, not the inability to injunct the monarch personally.
Option D is incorrect. There is no legal requirement for prior parliamentary justification; this is a political, not legal, constraint.
Option E is incorrect. The court would not delay on this basis; it would dismiss the application as non-justiciable.



Question 9 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Maria is the Claimant and makes a Part 36 offer to accept £50,000 from the Defendant, Ben, on 1st April. The Relevant Period expires on 22nd April. Ben rejects the offer and the case proceeds to trial. At trial, the Judge awards Maria £55,000. Ben argues that the costs should be awarded on the standard basis throughout, as the case was complex.
Which of the following describes the mandatory consequence regarding costs for the period after 22nd April?
A. Maria is entitled to an increase in damages not exceeding £75,000.
B. Maria is entitled to all her costs on the standard basis from the date of the offer.
C. Maria is entitled to her costs on the indemnity basis from the expiry of the Relevant Period.
D.  Maria is entitled to her costs on the indemnity basis from the date of the offer.
E. The court has discretion to award costs on the standard basis if indemnity costs would be unjust.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Where a claimant (Maria) obtains a judgment that is more advantageous than her own Part 36 offer, CPR 36.17(4) imposes mandatory costs sanctions on the defendant (Ben), unless the court considers them unjust. These sanctions, which apply from the expiry of the Relevant Period (22nd April), include: (1) Costs on the indemnity basis; (2) Interest on those costs at up to 10% above base rate; (3) Interest on the damages; and (4) an additional amount on the damages. Therefore, option D is incorrect
Option A is incorrect. An additional amount on the damages is an entitlement, but the question asks for the mandatory consequence regarding costs.
Option B is incorrect. Costs are awarded on the standard basis up to the expiry of the Relevant Period, and on the indemnity basis thereafter.
Option E is incorrect. The mandatory award is for indemnity costs, and the burden is on Ben to show why this would be unjust to avoid the sanction.
Question 10 (TORT)
Leah was involved in a minor rear-end collision caused by Asher’s negligent driving. The impact was slight, causing only superficial damage to the vehicles. However, Leah, unknown to Asher, had a pre-existing and asymptomatic weakness in her neck vertebrae due to a congenital condition. 
The jolt from the collision caused a disc in her neck to herniate, resulting in permanent and severe paralysis for which they had to rush her to the hospital immediately. The collision occurred on a busy road during daylight hours, with Asher failing to brake in time. Leah was wearing her seatbelt and driving cautiously. No other injuries were reported from the incident. In an action for negligence, Asher disputes that he is liable for the full extent of Leah’s catastrophic injuries. 

Is Asher liable for the full extent of Leah’s injuries?

 A. Asher is only liable for the injuries a reasonable person would have foreseen from such a minor collision.
B. Asher is only liable for the damage to Leah's vehicle, as the personal injury was too remote.
C. Asher is liable for the full extent of the injury, even if the extent was unforeseeable.
D. Leah's damages should be reduced to reflect the extent to which her pre-existing condition contributed to her injury.
E. Asher is not liable for the paralysis because it was caused by a "hidden defect" in Leah.

C is the correct option 

Explanation
C is the correct option. This is a precise statement of the "egg-shell skull" rule (or thin skull rule). A tortfeasor is liable for all the consequences of their negligent act, even if the victim suffers unusually severe damage due to a pre-existing physical or psychological vulnerability. The defendant takes their victim as they find them.
A is incorrect. This is the general rule for remoteness of damage (the type of harm must be foreseeable), but it is subject to the important exception of the "egg-shell skull" rule.
B is incorrect. The type of harm was clearly foreseeable from a car collision. The issue is the unforeseeable extent of that injury, which is covered by the egg-shell skull rule.
D is incorrect. Contributory negligence requires a failure by the claimant to take care for their own safety. Having a pre-existing medical condition is not a fault and does not constitute contributory negligence.
E is incorrect. This mischaracterises a pre-existing medical condition as a "defect" that breaks the chain of causation. The law is clear that such conditions do not break the chain; they are precisely what the egg-shell skull rule is designed to address.




Question 11 (BUSINESS LAW)
 Ethan, a successful leather goods trader, incorporated "Aron Ltd" to acquire his sole proprietorship business. The company's share capital was divided into 20,007 shares. Ethan took 20,001 shares, and his wife and five children each held one nominal share as nominees. The purchase price for the business was satisfied by the company issuing £10,000 in debentures (secured loan stock) to Ethan and paying the balance in cash.
Subsequently, the company's fortunes declined due to an industry-wide recession and it entered insolvent liquidation. The unsecured creditors argued that the company was a mere agent for Ethan, and that he should be personally liable for its debts, citing his dominant control and the fact the incorporation was solely to limit his liability.
Which of the following statements accurately determines Ethan's liability?
A.Ethan is personally liable because the company was essentially his alter ego, and the incorporation was a sham to defraud future creditors by limiting liability unfairly.
B. Ethan is not personally liable for the company's debts.
C. Ethan is liable because he held the vast majority of shares, and the veil of incorporation must be lifted to prevent an abuse of the corporate form where one individual exercises total control.
D. Ethan is liable only to the extent of the debentures he holds.
E. Ethan is not liable to trade creditors, but he may be liable for fraudulent trading.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The House of Lords in Salomon v. Salomon established the cornerstone principle of English company law: once a company is duly incorporated, it is a legal person separate and distinct from its members (shareholders). This principle applies even where one shareholder holds almost all the shares, where the company is effectively a one-man business, and where the primary motive for incorporation was to limit liability. The corporate "veil" cannot be pierced merely because the company is small or under dominant control. The fact that Ethan held debentures made him a secured creditor, not a guarantor of the company's other debts.
Option A is incorrect. This describes a potential ground for lifting the corporate veil (fraud or sham), but the facts do not indicate fraud. In Salomon, the Lords held that incorporating to limit liability is a legitimate purpose, not a fraud on creditors. The company was properly formed and conducted real business.
Option C is incorrect. While "lifting the veil" is possible in rare circumstances (e.g., where the company is a mere façade concealing true facts), total control by a single shareholder is not, in itself, an abuse of the corporate form. The principle of separate personality expressly accommodates this scenario.
Option D is incorrect. This misstates the legal position. Holding debentures gives Ethan a right to be paid as a creditor from the company's assets in priority to unsecured creditors. It does not create a liability for him. His liability as a shareholder is limited to any amount unpaid on his shares, which is typically nil for shares issued at full value.

Question 12 (BUSINESS LAW)
Beta Retail Ltd wants to hire Mr Micheal Peterson on its board of directors. The company wishes to pass an ordinary resolution to appoint the new director. The company’s articles are unamended Model Articles, and the company has two shareholders: Dev (70%) and Priya (30%). The directors propose to call a general meeting on short notice because the appointment is urgent. Dev agrees to short notice, but Priya refuses.
Can the meeting be validly held on short notice?
A. Yes, because ordinary resolutions can always be passed on short notice with a simple majority in favour.
B. Yes, because Dev holds more than 50% of the shares, and majority approval is sufficient to agree to short notice.
C. No, because short notice requires unanimous shareholder consent for any general meeting.
D. No, because short notice requires the consent of shareholders holding at least 90% of the voting rights.
E. Yes, because a meeting to appoint a director does not require special formalities.
Explanation
Option D is correct.
Under s.307(4) CA 2006, a general meeting of a private company may be held on short notice only if it is agreed by shareholders holding at least 90% of the voting rights (or a higher percentage if the articles require it). The Model Articles do not vary this rule. Dev has 70% and Priya 30%, meaning only 70% consent is available, so the statutory threshold is not met. Therefore, the meeting cannot be held on short notice.
Option A is incorrect.
Short notice does not depend on the type of resolution being ordinary or special.
Option B is incorrect.
Majority approval is insufficient; the statute requires at least 90% of the shareholders.
Option C is incorrect.
Unanimity is not required, 90% is sufficient.
Option E is incorrect.
The subject matter (appointing a director) does not override the statutory notice requirements.
Question 13 (BUSINESS LAW)
At a general meeting of Horizon Services Ltd, the company’s articles specify that the quorum is two members present in person or by proxy. Four shareholders attend the meeting:
Lina – 40% of the voting rights
Omar – 30%
Sara – 20%
Ben – 10%
A special resolution to amend the articles is proposed. Lina and Sara vote for the resolution (together holding 60%), while Omar and Ben vote against (together holding 40%).
Because the votes in favour do not reach the required statutory majority, Omar, acting as chair of the meeting, purports to use his casting vote to defeat the resolution.
What is the correct legal position?
A.The chair validly exercised his casting vote, and the resolution therefore fails.
B. The chair has no casting vote on a special resolution unless expressly provided for in the articles
C. The chair’s casting vote makes the resolution pass because special resolutions require only a simple majority of the members present.
D. The chair’s casting vote is invalid because casting votes can never be used in general meetings.
E. The resolution passes because the supporters collectively hold more than half of the voting rights.
Option B is correct.
Explanation
The correct legal position is B because a special resolution, which is required to amend a company's articles, must be passed by a majority of not less than 75% of the votes cast. Since the votes in favor totaled only 60% (Lina’s 40% and Sara’s 20%), the resolution failed the statutory threshold immediately. Furthermore, a chairperson has no inherent common law right to a casting vote; such a power must be expressly granted by the company’s Articles of Association.
Option A is incorrect.
A casting vote cannot be used to defeat or pass a resolution requiring a statutory supermajority; the failure arises from not meeting the 75% threshold.
Option C is incorrect.
Special resolutions require a 75% majority, not a simple majority.
Option D is incorrect.
Casting votes are not prohibited; they must be expressly conferred by the articles.
Option E is incorrect.
Holding more than 50% is insufficient for a special resolution. The statutory requirement is 75%.

Question 14 (TORT)
A large listed company, "TechGlobal plc," had its annual accounts audited by the firm "Felix & Co." The audited accounts, prepared for the statutory purpose of filing with Companies House, showed the company to be profitable. Aria, an existing shareholder, reviewed these published accounts and, relying on the reported financial health, purchased a significant number of additional shares on the open market. It later transpired that Felix & Co had been negligent in the audit, substantially overvaluing the company's assets. The share price collapsed when the truth emerged, causing Aria a large financial loss. Aria sues Felix & Co in negligence for her loss.
What is the principal legal obstacle to Aria establishing a duty of care owed to her by Felix & Co?
A. The loss is pure economic loss, which is never recoverable in negligence from a professional adviser.
B.  Aria must show a special relationship of proximity where the auditor knew the statement would be communicated to her,  and that she would rely on it.
C. Auditors owe a duty of care only to the company itself as their client, not to individual shareholders.
D. Aria's loss is too remote, as it was caused by market fluctuations following the disclosure of the truth, not directly by the negligent statement.
E. As an existing shareholder, Aria is owed a duty, but only in respect of decisions relating to her existing holding (e.g., voting), not for decisions to buy additional shares.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The House of Lords in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman (1990) established the modern test for a duty of care in cases of negligent misstatement causing pure economic loss. It requires (1) foreseeability, (2) a relationship of "proximity" between the parties, and (3) that it be fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty. For auditors, it was held that the statutory duty is owed to the body of shareholders as a whole for the purpose of enabling them to exercise collective control (e.g., at general meetings). It is not owed to individual shareholders for the purpose of making personal investment decisions, nor to potential investors. Proximity requires knowledge by the maker of the statement of the specific purpose for which it will be used by a specific individual or class.
Option A is incorrect. Pure economic loss is recoverable in negligence for misstatements under the Hedley Byrne principle, provided the three-stage Caparo test is met.
Option C is incorrect. While the duty to the company is contractual and clear, the question is whether a tortious duty extends to shareholders. Caparo held it does, but in a very limited way (see Option E). It is not an absolute bar.
Option D is incorrect. Remoteness is a separate element that would be considered only after a duty is established. The primary hurdle is the existence of the duty itself.
Option E is incorrect. This accurately reflects one finding in Caparo: a duty might be owed to an existing shareholder in relation to the management of their existing interest. However, the more general and principal obstacle is the lack of proximity for the specific transaction of buying more shares, as stated in Option B, which is the broader and more definitive principle from the case.

Question 15 (LEGAL SYSTEM)
The "Public Order (Streets and Parks) Act 2023" was enacted following public concern about homeless encampments causing obstructions and hygiene issues. Section 1(1) creates an offence: "No person shall sleep in any designated public park between the hours of 11.00 pm and 6.00 am." Daniel, a homeless man, was charged under the section after being found by a park warden at 2.00 am. He was sitting upright on a bench, wrapped in a sleeping bag, with his eyes open. He argued he was "keeping watch" over his belongings and was not asleep. The prosecution argues that being present with bedding during the prohibited hours with the intention of sleeping is sufficient.
If the court applies the Mischief Rule to interpret 'sleep', what is the central focus of its inquiry?
A. The ordinary, dictionary meaning of the word "sleep" as a state of unconscious rest.
B. The grammatical structure of the sentence to determine if "sleep" is used as a verb or a noun.
C. The problem that the Act was designed to remedy, and the remedy Parliament intended to provide.
D. Whether applying the literal meaning leads to an absurdity that Parliament could not have intended.
E. Any relevant reports from Parliamentary debates (Hansard) to ascertain the legislator's specific intent.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The Mischief Rule, established in Heydon's Case (1584), directs the court to consider four questions: (1) What was the common law before the Act? (2) What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide? (3) What remedy did Parliament intend to provide? (4) The true reason for the remedy. The court then interprets the statute in a way that suppresses the mischief and advances the remedy. Here, the court would ask: Was the mischief the act of sleeping per se, or was it the presence of encampments and people residing in parks overnight? If the latter, the court might interpret "sleep" to include the act of bedding down for the night, regardless of whether the person was momentarily unconscious.
Option A is incorrect. This describes the Literal Rule, which gives words their plain, ordinary meaning without looking at context or purpose.
Option B is incorrect. This is a part of grammatical or literal interpretation, but not the focus of the Mischief Rule.
Option D is incorrect. This describes the Golden Rule, which allows a departure from the literal meaning only to avoid an absurd result.
Option E is incorrect. This refers to the use of extrinsic aids, specifically Pepper v Hart, which allows reference to Hansard in limited circumstances to clarify ambiguous legislation. It is a specific modern practice, not the classical Mischief Rule.
Question 16 (LEGAL SERVICES)
Solicitor Lucas is acting for a client, Mr. Patel, in the purchase of a £2 million commercial property. During due diligence, Lucas becomes suspicious about the origin of the funds, which are arriving from a complex series of overseas trusts. Following his firm's procedures, he makes an internal disclosure to the firm's Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO), who agrees and submits a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) to the National Crime Agency (NCA). The NCA acknowledges receipt. Seven working days pass with no response from the NCA denying consent. Lucas proceeds with the completion. A week later, Mr. Patel emails Lucas asking, "I noticed the completion was delayed by a week. Was there a hold-up with my funds from the trust? I need to reassure my trustees."
To avoid committing the 'tipping off' offence under s.333A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, what is Lucas's safest response?
A. "There were some routine compliance checks on large transactions, which are now complete. It's nothing to worry about."
B. "The delay was due to our internal processes. We are unable to discuss the specifics as they relate to confidential legal advice and regulatory procedures."
C. "As required by law, we had to report certain aspects of the transaction to the authorities, which caused a brief delay. This is now resolved."
D. "I am no longer able to act for you in this matter due to professional obligations. You should seek alternative representation."
E. Ignore the email and make a second SAR to the NCA regarding this enquiry, as it may be an attempt to test the firm's defences.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The tipping off offence prohibits disclosing "any matter which is likely to prejudice any investigation" that might be conducted following a SAR. The safest course is to give a neutral, non-committal response that does not confirm or deny that a SAR was made, does not reveal any suspicion, and does not indicate that an investigation might be underway. Referring vaguely to "internal processes" and "confidential legal advice" provides a plausible explanation without disclosing potentially prejudicial information. Any response that hints at reporting to authorities (Option C) or gives a specific but false reason (Option A) is high-risk.
Option A is incorrect. Providing a specific but inaccurate reason for the delay ("routine compliance checks") could itself be problematic and, if the client infers the true reason, might still be construed as a disclosure likely to prejudice an investigation.
Option C is incorrect. This directly discloses that a report was made to "the authorities," which is highly likely to constitute tipping off. It explicitly informs the client that they are under scrutiny.
Option D is incorrect. While ceasing to act may be necessary, suddenly dropping a client with a minimal explanation after a SAR can itself be a "red flag" that may prejudice an investigation by alerting the client. If withdrawal is necessary, it should be done with extreme caution and legal advice.
Option E is incorrect. The client's enquiry, while awkward, is not automatically suspicious enough to warrant a second SAR. The primary concern is how to answer the question lawfully, not necessarily to escalate reporting.
Question 17 (BUSINESS LAW)
 Elijah and Jasmine agreed to go into partnership to open an Indian restaurant. Jasmine is a successful business owner while Elijah has been unable to get a job. They found suitable premises, obtained planning permission for a change of use, signed a lease, took out a business loan in their joint names to fund renovations, ordered kitchen equipment, and hired a head chef. 
Before the restaurant opened for trading, a dispute arose over the division of responsibilities, and Jasmine claimed that no partnership existed as they had not yet started business. Elijah insists that they have a partnership 
At what point did a partnership between Elijah and Jasmine come into existence?
A. When they opened the restaurant to the public and made their first sale.
B. When they signed a formal, written partnership agreement.
C. When they embarked on the series of mutual steps necessary to establish the business with a view to profit
D. When they registered the partnership for Value Added Tax (VAT).
E. Only when they began to share the profits generated from actual trading.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The House of Lords in Khan v Miah clarified that a partnership under the Partnership Act 1890 (defined as "the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit") can begin as soon as the parties start carrying on the business. "Carrying on" can include the preparatory activities essential to launch the business, such as securing premises, arranging finance, and ordering stock. The key is the joint pursuit of a common business objective with a view to profit, not the receipt of the first customer payment.
Option A is incorrect. This represents a common but outdated view. Khan v Miah explicitly rejected the argument that a partnership only begins upon the commencement of trading.
Option B is incorrect. A partnership can be formed orally or by conduct; a written agreement is not a legal requirement for formation, though it is highly advisable.
Option D is incorrect. VAT registration is a tax administrative requirement that occurs after a business is established and expects turnover to exceed the threshold. It is not a determinant of the partnership's legal existence.
Option E is incorrect. Sharing profits is strong evidence of a partnership, but it is not the only evidence. The activity of carrying on business is the statutory test. Profits may not be generated for some time after the business starts being carried on.
Question 18 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
The claimant, Noah, issued proceedings for breach of contract. The defendant, Chloe, applied for summary judgment under CPR Part 24 because a key clause in the contract was, on its true construction, a condition precedent that had not been fulfilled. In response, Noah filed a witness statement from a Queen's Counsel expressing the opinion that the clause was an innominate term, and that the court at trial was likely to find the breach did not go to the root of the contract.
In determining the application, what is the correct legal test the court must apply?
A. Whether, on the evidence before the court, the claimant has a case which is more likely than not to succeed at trial.
B. Whether the claimant has a real prospect of succeeding on the claim or issue.
C. Whether the court can decide the point of construction conclusively at the interim stage without the need for a full trial.
D. Whether the defendant has shown that the claimant's case is bound to fail.
E. Whether the issue is so complex and important that it should be determined at a trial, regardless of the apparent strength of the claim.
Explanation
Option B is correct. CPR 24.2 provides that the court may give summary judgment if it considers that the claimant "has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim or issue" and "there is no other compelling reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial." "Real prospect" means a prospect that is realistic, not one that is merely arguable or fanciful. The court does not conduct a mini-trial but assesses whether the claim crosses this minimum threshold of credibility.
Option A is incorrect. This sets the bar too high ("more likely than not") and is the civil standard of proof at trial, not the test for resisting summary judgment.
Option C is incorrect. While the court can decide a point of construction summarily if it is suitable for determination without trial, this is not the test itself. It is a factor in applying the "real prospect" test. The test remains whether the claimant's argument on construction has a real prospect of success.
Option D is incorrect. This misstates the burden. The defendant, as applicant, must show the claimant has no real prospect. They do not need to show the claim is "bound to fail," which is a slightly higher threshold often associated with strike-out applications under CPR 3.4.
Option E is incorrect. This confuses summary judgment with case management. The existence of a "compelling reason" for a trial is the second limb of the CPR 24.2 test. However, the primary question is the "real prospect" of success. Complexity alone is not a "compelling reason" if the claim has no real prospect.
Question 19 (CONTRACT)
A standard form contract between two businesses, "DataHost Ltd" (supplier) and "ClientCorp plc" (customer), for the provision of cloud storage services contained the following clause: 
"Liability - The total liability of DataHost, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, for any loss or damage shall not exceed 125% of the fees paid by the ClientCorp in the 12 months preceding the claim."
A catastrophic system failure at DataHost caused ClientCorp to lose critical data, resulting in a provable loss of £5 million. The fees paid in the prior 12 months were £100,000, capping liability at £125,000. ClientCorp argues the clause is unfair under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (UCTA).
Under UCTA, what is the legal test for the validity of this limitation of liability clause?
A. The clause is automatically void if it attempts to exclude liability for negligence.
B. The clause is subject to a test of reasonableness, considering the circumstances at the time the contract was made.
C. The clause is valid if it was brought to ClientCorp's attention before the contract was signed.
D. The clause is valid because it does not exclude liability altogether but merely limits it.
E. The clause is invalid because it is contained in a standard form contract where the parties had unequal bargaining power.
Explanation
Option B is correct. This is a limitation clause (not an exclusion clause) in a business-to-business contract. UCTA applies differently to different types of clauses. For limitation clauses, s.11(1) states the requirement of reasonableness is that "the term shall have been a fair and reasonable one to be included having regard to the circumstances which were, or ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made." Schedule 2 provides a non-exhaustive list of guidelines for reasonableness, including bargaining strength, opportunity to contract elsewhere, and whether the customer knew or ought to have known of the term.
Option A is incorrect. This rule applies to clauses that exclude or restrict liability for negligence causing death or personal injury (s.2(1)), which are void. It also applies to clauses excluding liability for other loss from negligence (s.2(2)), which are subject to reasonableness. This is a limitation clause, not a complete exclusion.
Option C is incorrect. This relates to the common law requirement for incorporation of terms. Even if properly incorporated, a limitation clause must still satisfy the statutory reasonableness test under UCTA.
Option D is incorrect. The fact it is a limitation clause, not an exclusion clause, determines which section of UCTA applies (s.3(2)(a) for contracts based on standard terms, or s.6 and 7 for sale of goods/supply of services). It does not make it automatically valid.
Option E is incorrect. Unequal bargaining power is a factor listed in Schedule 2 for the court to consider when assessing reasonableness. It is not, by itself, a rule that invalidates the clause.
Question 20 (TORT)
An employee, Caleb, worked as a customer service manager at a large furniture warehouse, "MegaFurnish Ltd." His duties included handling customer complaints and supervising the loading bay. A customer, Mr. Lee, returned with a damaged table, demanding an immediate refund. Caleb became enraged by Mr. Lee's persistent and loud complaints. An argument escalated, and Caleb, shouting "I'll teach you not to mess with us!", shoved Mr. Lee, causing him to fall and fracture his wrist. MegaFurnish had clear policies against violence and provided de-escalation training.
What is the decisive factor in determining if MegaFurnish is vicariously liable for Caleb's assault?
A.Whether the assault was so closely connected with acts Caleb was employed to do that it may be regarded as done to benefit the company.
B. Whether the assault was so closely connected with acts Caleb was authorised to do that it may be regarded as done in the course of his employment.
C. Whether MegaFurnish was negligent in hiring or training Caleb, thereby creating the risk that he would commit such an act.
D. Whether the assault occurred on MegaFurnish's premises during working hours.
E. Whether Caleb intended to further his employer's business interests, even if through misguided means.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The Supreme Court in Mohamud (and later cases like Barclays Bank v Various Claimants) refined the test for vicarious liability. The court asks: (1) What functions or "field of activities" was the employee authorised to do? (2) Was there a sufficient connection between that field of activities and the wrongful conduct? The connection must be so close that it is fair to hold the employer liable. Here, Caleb was authorised to interact with customers and deal with complaints. The assault arose directly from that interaction. While the mode of dealing with it was wrongful and criminal, it was inextricably linked to the performance of his job duties.Therefore, Option A is incorrect.
Option C is incorrect. This would found a claim for direct liability in negligence by the employer. Vicarious liability is a separate, strict liability doctrine that does not require employer fault.
Option D is incorrect. Time and place are relevant factors but not decisive. An employee can be acting in the course of employment off-premises, and can be outside the course of employment on-premises (e.g., during a purely personal fight).
Option E is incorrect. This was part of the older, discredited test from Salmon v Seafarer Restaurant. The modern test does not require the employee to be acting to further the employer's business; it focuses on the connection between the job and the tort.
Question 21 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
A local council refused planning permission for a family to build an extension to their home to accommodate an elderly disabled relative, citing a minor infringement of local density guidelines. The family claimed this decision disproportionately interfered with their right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
Under s.6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA), what is the primary obligation of the council, as a public authority, regarding this decision?
A. To act in a way that is compatible with Convention rights, meaning any interference must be lawful and be proportionate.
B. To make decisions that are reasonable in the Wednesbury sense, and the HRA does not change this standard of review.
C. To refer any case involving a potential breach of the ECHR to the Secretary of State for a determination.
D. To give precedence to the Convention rights over any other statutory duty, even if this means disregarding the town planning legislation.
E. To pay compensation automatically to the family if the decision is found to interfere with their Article 8 rights.
Explanation
Option A is correct. Section 6(1) HRA states it is "unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right." This imposes a substantive obligation. For a qualified right like Article 8, any interference must be (i) in accordance with the law, (ii) for a legitimate aim (e.g., protection of the rights of others, public safety), and (iii) necessary in a democratic society  i.e., proportionate. The court will assess whether the council struck a fair balance.
Option B is incorrect. The HRA fundamentally changed judicial review in rights cases. The court must assess proportionality, which is a more intensive standard of review than traditional Wednesbury unreasonableness. The court asks if the decision was necessary, not just if it was within a range of reasonable responses.
Option C is incorrect. There is no such referral mechanism in the HRA. It is for the domestic courts to determine compliance.
Option D is incorrect. Section 6(2) HRA provides a defence if the authority was acting to give effect to primary legislation which cannot be interpreted compatibly with the Convention. The council cannot disregard its statutory duties under planning law. Its obligation is to interpret and apply those laws, as far as possible, compatibly with Convention rights (s.3 HRA).
Option E is incorrect. Section 8 HRA gives courts a discretion to award damages if satisfied they are necessary to afford "just satisfaction." Damages are not automatic and are awarded less frequently than in tort claims.

Question 22 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Chloe and David were co-directors and equal shareholders in a now-dissolved marketing agency. Chloe is bringing a claim against David, alleging he misappropriated the company’s confidential client database and is unlawfully soliciting its former clients for his new venture. Chloe’s solicitor applies for an interim injunction to restrain David from contacting the clients on the list until trial. 
At the urgent hearing, the judge must decide whether to grant the injunction. The evidence shows the database is highly valuable and its misuse could cause Chloe irreparable loss of clientele, but David argues the clients are free to choose whom to instruct.
Applying the correct principles for interim relief, which of the following is the paramount consideration for the judge?
A. Whether Chloe has proved on the balance of probabilities that she will succeed at trial.
B. The balance of convenience and whether damages would be an adequate remedy for either party.
C. Whether refusing the injunction would render Chloe’s eventual trial success meaningless.
D. Whether David’s conduct amounts to a clear breach of a fiduciary duty.
E. The relative financial strength of the parties and Chloe’s ability to give a cross-undertaking in damages.
Correct Option: B
Explanation: Option B is correct. The governing test for most interim injunctions is from American Cyanamid v Ethicon. The court considers: (1) Is there a serious issue to be tried? (a low threshold). If yes, (2) the adequacy of damages for either party, and (3) the balance of convenience. The balance of convenience is often the decisive factor.

Option A is incorrect; the applicant does not need to prove a prima facie case or a likelihood of success on the merits at the interim stage, only a serious issue.
Option C is incorrect; while this is a factor within the balance of convenience (the risk of irremediable harm), it is not the sole or paramount consideration in isolation.
Option D is incorrect; while the alleged breach of duty is the substantive issue, the interim hearing focuses on the procedural test for preserving the status quo, not on making a final determination on the breach.
Option E is incorrect; while the claimant’s ability to honour a cross-undertaking in damages is a practical consideration within the balance of convenience, it is not the paramount legal test.
Question 23 (CONTRACT)
Eleanor entered into a detailed contract with Benjamin on 1st July for the sale of her unique, vintage Aston Martin DB5 for £250,000. The contract specified completion (payment and delivery) for 1st October. On 15th September, Benjamin sent Eleanor an email stating: “Due to unforeseen financial difficulties, I will be unable to complete the purchase on 1st October. I release you from the contract and suggest you sell the car elsewhere.” Eleanor wishes to take immediate action.
Which of the following statements most accurately reflects Eleanor’s legal rights following Benjamin’s communication?
A. Eleanor must wait until 1st October to see if Benjamin performs before she can treat the contract as repudiated.
B. Eleanor can, if she chooses, immediately accept Benjamin’s repudiation, terminate the contract, and sue for damages.
C. Eleanor is obliged to attempt to mitigate her loss by advertising the car for sale before she can claim any damages.
D. Benjamin’s statement is merely an expression of doubt, not a clear repudiation, so Eleanor cannot yet terminate.
E. Eleanor can terminate immediately but must return any deposit paid before commencing her claim for damages.
Correct Option: B
Explanation: Option B is correct. A clear and unequivocal renunciation of future obligations constitutes an anticipatory repudiatory breach (Hochster v De La Tour). The innocent party has an election: to affirm the contract and wait for the performance date, or to accept the repudiation, treat the contract as discharged, and sue for damages immediately.
Option A is incorrect; the innocent party is not obliged to keep the contract alive and wait for the breach to actually occur.
Option C is incorrect; the duty to mitigate arises only after the contract has been terminated and a cause of action for damages has accrued. Acceptance of repudiation comes first.
Option D is incorrect; the statement is a clear refusal to perform, not mere doubt or a request for renegotiation.
Option E is incorrect; acceptance of repudiation does not require the return of any deposit as a precondition. The deposit forms part of the accounting in the subsequent damages claim.
Question 24 (TORT)
Rachel operates "Bright Minds Tutoring Ltd," an agency providing home tutors. She engages tutors under contracts labelled "Freelance Tutor Agreement." The agreement states tutors are self-employed, responsible for their own tax, can refuse work, and use their own materials. Matthew, a tutor engaged under such an agreement, is driving his own car from one student’s home to another when he negligently collides with a cyclist, causing severe injury. The cyclist wishes to claim against Bright Minds Tutoring Ltd, arguing Matthew was effectively its employee.
In determining vicarious liability, which of the following modern approaches would the court most likely apply?
A. Applying the strict control test to find no liability, as Matthew controlled how he taught and travelled.
B. Finding liability because Matthew was engaged in furthering the business interests of the agency at the time of the accident.
C. Undertaking a holistic assessment of whether Matthew was integrated into the agency’s business operation, making it fair to impose liability.
D. Holding the agency liable only if it was negligent in recruiting or instructing Matthew.
E. Finding no liability as the "independent contractor" label in the contract is definitive.
Correct Option: C
Explanation: Option C is correct. Modern case law (e.g., Various Claimants v Barclays Bank, Cox v Ministry of Justice) has moved from a rigid control test to a broader, two-stage test: (1) Is the relationship one "akin to employment"? (2) Is the tort sufficiently closely connected to that relationship? Stage 1 involves a holistic evaluation of factors including integration into the business, who provides equipment, and the degree of financial risk.
Option A is incorrect; while control remains a relevant factor, it is no longer the sole determinant.
Option B is incorrect; while being on business is necessary for "close connection," the preliminary question is whether the relationship itself is sufficiently employment-like.
Option D is incorrect; this would relate to a primary negligence claim, not vicarious liability for the tort of another.
Option E is incorrect; the contractual label is not conclusive. The court will look at the reality of the working relationship.
Question 25 (LEGAL SYSTEM)
In the High Court (Queen’s Bench Division), Mr Justice Adams is hearing a novel claim regarding data privacy in a commercial context. The claimant’s barrister cites extensive obiter dicta from a recent Supreme Court judgment in a case concerning governmental data collection, where the justices expressed strong views on the value of informational autonomy. The defendant’s barrister relies on a binding, directly relevant Court of Appeal precedent from 2015 which supports her client’s position.
How is Mr Justice Adams most likely to approach these conflicting authorities?
A. He is strictly bound by the Court of Appeal precedent and must follow it, regardless of the Supreme Court's obiter.
B. He must follow the Supreme Court's obiter dicta as it represents the latest and highest judicial reasoning.
C. He is not bound by the Supreme Court's obiter but may find it highly persuasive and distinguish the Court of Appeal precedent on its facts.
D. He should adjourn the case and transfer it to the Court of Appeal to resolve the conflict.
E. He should apply the Court of Appeal precedent but grant permission to appeal so the Supreme Court can reconsider the area.
Correct Option: C
Explanation: Option C is correct. The High Court is bound by the ratio decidendi of Court of Appeal decisions. Obiter dicta, even from the Supreme Court, are not binding. However, such obiter can be of immensely strong persuasive authority, especially when it indicates a modern legal principle that a lower court may adopt, potentially by distinguishing an older binding precedent on its facts.
Option A is incorrect; while bound by the Court of Appeal's ratio, a judge can sometimes avoid its application by distinguishing the cases on their facts, especially with strong persuasive obiter from a higher court pointing in a new direction.
Option B is incorrect; no court is bound by obiter dicta, only by the ratio.
Option D is incorrect; a first-instance judge cannot simply transfer a case to resolve a perceived conflict with obiter; they must decide the case before them.
Option E is incorrect; this is not the correct procedural response. The judge decides the case, and a party may then appeal.


Question 26 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
Sophie, a solicitor, acts for Mr Carter in financially complex divorce proceedings. During a private consultation, Mr Carter reveals that he has a concealed offshore bank account containing €500,000, which he has not disclosed in his Form E. Sophie advises him in the strongest terms of his duty to make full and frank disclosure to the court. Mr Carter refuses, stating, "It’s none of her business or the court’s. This is my money from before the marriage." Sophie is deeply concerned.
What is Sophie’s overriding professional obligation in this situation?
A. To maintain strict client confidentiality, as the information is protected by legal professional privilege.
B. To cease acting for the client immediately but maintain confidentiality, informing the court only that she has withdrawn.
C. To disclose the information to the court to prevent deception.
D. To continue acting but file the Form E as instructed, adding a disclaimer that it is based on information provided by the client.
E. To report the matter to the SRA and await their guidance before taking any further steps in the case.
Option B is correct
Explanation: Option B is correct. A solicitor has an overriding duty to the court not to be complicit in misleading the court. If a client refuses to disclose a material asset in financial proceedings, the solicitor cannot continue to act because doing so would result in the solicitor presenting a case they know to be false. However, the solicitor also owes a duty of confidentiality to the client, which survives the end of the retainer. Therefore, the solicitor must withdraw from the case ("cease to act") but cannot reveal the specific reason or the existence of the offshore account to the court or third parties without the client's express consent.
Option A is incorrect; while confidentiality is vital, it does not permit a solicitor to continue representing a client while they are actively deceiving the court.
Option C is incorrect; although it may seem ethically "right" to prevent deception, a solicitor cannot breach legal professional privilege or confidentiality to disclose a client’s past dishonesty or hidden assets in this context. Disclosing the information would be a breach of the SRA Code of Conduct.
Option D is incorrect; a solicitor cannot distance themselves from a known lie by using a disclaimer. Submitting a document known to be false is a direct violation of the duty to act with integrity and the duty to the court.
Option E is incorrect; while the SRA provides an ethics helpline, the legal position is established: once a client confirms they intend to mislead the court and refuses to correct the record, the solicitor's immediate obligation is to withdraw from the record.
Question 27 (BUSINESS LAW)
Claudia is a non-executive director of "SturdyBuild Plc," a listed company. The board is reviewing final dividend recommendations. The company has strong distributable profits. However, Claudia has seen a confidential engineering report warning that the company's primary manufacturing plant will require a mandatory and very costly safety refit within the next 18 months. The CFO proposes funding this via future debt. Claudia is concerned that paying the full dividend now will weaken the company's balance sheet ahead of this major expenditure.
When deciding how to vote on the dividend, what is Claudia’s core duty under Companies Act 2006?
A. To act in the interests of the shareholders present, who expect a generous dividend.
B. To defer to the collective commercial judgment of the executive directors.
C. To promote the company's success for its members, considering the long-term consequences of her decision.
D. To ensure the dividend is legally permissible under the distributable profits rules.
E. To avoid a conflict of interest, and as she has none, she should approve the board’s recommendation.
Correct Option: C
Explanation: Option C is correct. S.172(1) CA 2006 requires a director to act in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. This includes having regard (amongst other matters) to "the likely consequences of any decision in the long term." Claudia must exercise her independent judgment on whether the dividend is prudent in light of the known future capital requirement.
Option A is incorrect; the duty is to promote the success of the company for the members as a whole, which is not synonymous with short-term shareholder preferences.
Option B is incorrect; while she should take advice, she must exercise her own independent judgment (s.173).
Option D is incorrect; ensuring legal permissibility under s.830 (distributable profits) is a separate, minimum requirement, but complying with it does not automatically satisfy the broader s.172 duty.
Option E is incorrect; the absence of a personal conflict (s.175) does not absolve her from the positive duty to exercise judgment under s.172.
Question 28 (BUSINESS LAW)
Three shareholders of Delta Homeware Ltd , Mary, Mike and Shawn jointly hold 9% of the company’s voting shares. They deliver a written request to the directors requiring the company to call a general meeting to discuss concerns about the company’s financial management. The directors ignore the request and take no action within 21 days because they are a minority compared to the remaining 3057 shareholders. The three shareholders wish to proceed.
What is the correct legal position under Companies Act 2006?
A.The shareholders cannot validly requisition a meeting unless they hold at least 10% of the voting rights.
B. The shareholders may themselves call the meeting because the directors failed to comply
C. The requisition automatically becomes void if the directors do not call the meeting within 21 days.
D. The shareholders must apply to the court for permission to hold a general meeting.
E. The shareholders may call the meeting only if all shareholders unanimously agree.
Explanation
Option B is correct.
Under s.303 CA 2006, shareholders holding at least 5% of the voting rights can require the directors to call a general meeting. If the directors fail to call the meeting within 21 days, s.305 CA 2006 allows the requisitionists themselves to call it. Here, they hold 9%, so they may proceed.
Option A is incorrect: The threshold is 5%, not 10%.
Option C is incorrect: The request does not lapse solely due to director inaction.
Option D is incorrect: Court involvement is not required in this scenario.
Option E is incorrect: Unanimous consent is not necessary.
Question 29 (BUSINESS LAW)
Omega Software Ltd , a private company that makes furniture wishes to pass an ordinary resolution to approve a service contract for a new director, Mr Micheal. The directors circulate a written resolution. One shareholder, Priyanka, argues that the resolution is invalid because it was not passed at a general meeting.
What is the legal position?
A. The written resolution is invalid because resolutions relating to directors’ service contracts must be passed at a meeting.
B. The written resolution is valid only if the articles specifically authorise written resolutions.
C. The written resolution is valid because private companies may pass any resolution except to remove a director or auditor, by written resolution.
D. The written resolution is invalid unless all shareholders unanimously agree.
E. The written resolution is valid because private companies may pass any resolution  by written resolution.

Explanation
Option C is correct.
Under s.288 CA 2006, private companies may pass any resolution by written resolution, except resolutions to remove a director or auditor. Approving a director’s service contract is not excluded. Therefore, E is incorrect.
Option A is incorrect: No meeting requirement exists.
Option B is incorrect: Written resolutions apply automatically unless excluded (rare).
Option D is incorrect: Ordinary written resolutions require a simple majority, not unanimity.
Option E is incorrect: There are exceptions such as; resolutions to remove a director or auditor 


Question 30 (TORT)
"National Power Co." owns and operates an electrical substation in a suburban area. It is surrounded by a 2-metre high chain-link fence with prominent signs reading "DANGER – HIGH VOLTAGE – NO TRESPASSING." Local children often play in the adjacent field. Adam, aged 10, climbs the fence to retrieve his football. Inside, he is gravely injured when he touches a piece of equipment that was poorly maintained and had exposed live parts. Adam’s father claims under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.
For a duty of care to be owed to Adam under the 1984 Act, which of the following must be established?
A. That the occupier intended to cause harm to trespassers or acted with reckless disregard for their safety.
B. That the occupier owed the common duty of care under the 1957 Act because the danger was due to the state of the premises.
C. That the occupier knew or had reasonable grounds to know of the danger and that children might trespass near it.
D. That the warning signs were insufficiently clear to deter a child of Adam’s age.
E. That the injury occurred inside a structure, not on open land.
Correct Option: C
Explanation: Option C is correct. The duty to trespassers under OLA 1984 s.1(3) arises if: (a) the occupier is aware of the danger or has reasonable grounds to believe it exists; (b) knows or has reasonable grounds to believe the trespasser is in, or may come into, the vicinity of the danger; and (c) the risk is one against which, in all the circumstances, the occupier may reasonably be expected to offer some protection. Knowledge includes the likelihood of child trespassers (Jolley v Sutton LBC).
Option A is incorrect; this was the harsh pre-1984 common law position, now superseded by statute.
Option B is incorrect; the 1957 Act applies only to visitors (lawful entrants). Trespassers are governed by the 1984 Act.
Option D is incorrect; the adequacy of warnings is a factor in whether the occupier has taken reasonable steps to discharge the duty (s.1(5)), not part of the initial test for whether a duty is owed.
Option E is incorrect; the 1984 Act applies to premises of any kind, not just structures.



Question 31 (BUSINESS LAW)

Zephyr Ltd, a manufacturing company, granted a fixed legal charge over its factory premises to SecureBank plc in January 2024 to secure a term loan of £2 million. The charge was properly registered at Companies House within the 21-day period. In June 2024, without seeking SecureBank's consent, Zephyr sold the factory to Orion Ltd, an unrelated property investment company, for its market value of £3.5 million. Orion's due diligence searches at Companies House failed to reveal the charge due to an administrative error by its solicitor. Zephyr subsequently entered administration. SecureBank now seeks to enforce its security against the factory, which Orion occupies.

Can SecureBank enforce its fixed charge against the factory in Orion's hands?
A. No, because Orion purchased the factory in good faith for value without notice of the charge.
B. Yes, because registration at Companies House constitutes actual notice to all subsequent purchasers.
C. No, because a fixed charge over land must be registered at the Land Registry to bind a purchaser.
D. Yes, because registration at Companies House is deemed to give notice to the world.
E. No, because SecureBank’s failure to ensure its charge was noted on the title at the Land Registry makes it void against Orion.

Correct Option: D
Explanation: Option D is correct. Under s.859H of the Companies Act 2006, registration of a charge at Companies House is deemed to constitute notice of the charge to any person acquiring an interest in the charged property. This is a statutory fiction of notice. Therefore, Orion is deemed to have had notice of the charge regardless of its actual knowledge or the solicitor's error. The charge remains enforceable against the asset.
Option A is incorrect because the doctrine of “bona fide purchaser for value without notice” is overridden by the statutory deemed notice provision in the Companies Act 2006.
Option B is incorrect; registration constitutes deemed notice, not necessarily actual notice. The distinction is that the law treats Orion as if it had notice, irrespective of fact.
Option C is incorrect; while registration at the Land Registry provides stronger protection and may be required for legal mortgages over registered land, the Companies Act registration is sufficient to bind a company’s assets as against a purchaser from the company.
Option E is incorrect; while best practice involves Land Registry registration, the failure to do so does not automatically invalidate a company charge registered at Companies House against a purchaser from the company.

Question 32 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

A claimant, domiciled in England, brings a High Court claim for breach of a consultancy contract against a defendant company domiciled in France. The contract was negotiated and signed in Paris, and the alleged breach occurred there. The written contract contains a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause stating that “the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.” The claimant’s solicitor issues a claim form in London and must now effect service.

What is the most important procedural step the claimant must take to validly serve the claim form on the defendant in France?

A. Serve the claim form directly on the defendant’s French registered office, following French law procedures.
B. Apply to the English court for permission to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction.
C. Serve the claim form on the defendant’s English solicitor, if they have one instructed to accept service.
D. Request the French judicial authorities to effect service via the Hague Service Convention.
E.  Apply to the French court for permission to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction.

Correct Option: B
Explanation: Option B is correct. Under CPR r.6.36 and PD6B, service of a claim form out of the jurisdiction generally requires the permission of the court, unless the case falls within certain exceptions in r.6.33. A non-exclusive jurisdiction clause does not, of itself, dispense with the need for permission. The claimant must apply, demonstrating that England is the proper place to bring the claim (the forum conveniens). Therefore E is incorrect
Option A is incorrect because the method of service is secondary; the primary requirement is to obtain permission to serve out, unless an exception applies.
Option C is incorrect; service on a solicitor is only valid if that solicitor is authorised to accept service. Furthermore, permission to serve out may still be required.
Option D is incorrect; while service through the Hague Convention or other international mechanisms is the prescribed method after permission is obtained (or if service is allowed without permission), the first critical step is securing the court’s permission to serve out.

Question 33 (CONTRACT)
Thomas, an art collector, purchases a painting from Diana, a reputable art dealer, for £50,000. During negotiations, Diana stated, “This is an original 19th-century landscape by John Constable.” Relying on this, Thomas buys it. The written invoice describes the painting only as “19th-century landscape.” Thomas later discovers the painting is a skilled 20th-century forgery. Diana had purchased it from another dealer who assured her it was genuine, and she had not obtained independent expert verification. Thomas seeks to rescind the contract and recover his money.
Which of the following claims is Thomas most likely to succeed with?

A. Rescission for common mistake, as both parties were mistaken as to the painting’s authenticity.
B. Damages under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 for negligent misrepresentation.
C. Damages for breach of a contractual term that the painting was by Constable.
D. Rescission for innocent misrepresentation.
E. Damages in the tort of deceit for fraudulent misrepresentation.

Correct Option: D

Explanation: 

Option D is correct. Diana made a specific statement of fact regarding the artist ("by John Constable") which was false and induced Thomas to purchase the painting. Because Diana honestly believed the statement was true (based on the previous dealer's assurance), but lacked reasonable grounds for that belief since she failed to get independent verification, the statement is at least an innocent misrepresentation. 
Under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the primary remedy for misrepresentation is rescission, which aims to return the parties to their pre-contractual positions by returning the painting and the £50,000.
Option A is incorrect; under the rule in Leaf v International Galleries, a mistake as to the artist of a painting is usually considered a mistake as to quality rather than subject matter. Therefore, the contract is not void for common mistake as the "thing" (a painting) still exists.
Option B is incorrect; while negligent misrepresentation (s.2(1) Misrepresentation Act 1967) provides damages, Thomas's primary goal is to "rescind the contract and recover his money." Option D directly addresses the remedy of rescission which is more likely to succeed as a starting point.
Option C is incorrect; because the written invoice omitted the name "Constable," the court may apply the Parol Evidence Rule, viewing the written document as the final version of the contract and treating the oral statement as a mere representation rather than a binding contractual term.
Option E is incorrect; a claim in deceit (fraudulent misrepresentation) requires proving that Diana knew the statement was false or was reckless as to its truth (Derry v Peek). Since she was assured by another dealer, she acted honestly, albeit perhaps carelessly, which defeats a claim of fraud.




Question 34 (LEGAL SERVICES)
A law firm, "Miller & Partners," currently operates as a traditional partnership with four partners. The firm is considering converting its legal structure to a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) to protect the partners' personal assets. The partners are reviewing their Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) to understand how this change will affect their regulatory obligations. Their current insurance cover is £2 million
According to the SRA Indemnity Insurance Rules, what change, if any, will be required to the firm's minimum level of cover for any one claim upon conversion to an LLP?
A.No change is required; the minimum level of cover remains £2 million for all law firms. 
B.The minimum level of cover must increase to £3 million. 
C.The minimum level of cover must increase to £5 million because LLPs provide limited liability to members. 
D. The minimum level of cover decreases to £1.5 million because the firm is now an incorporated body. 
E.The minimum level of cover will be determined by the SRA based on the firm's last three years of fee income.
Correct Option: B
Explanation: Option B is correct. Under the SRA Indemnity Insurance Rules and the Minimum Terms and Conditions (MTC), the required minimum level of PII cover is determined by the firm’s legal structure. For unincorporated bodies (such as sole practitioners and traditional partnerships), the minimum is £2 million. For incorporated bodies (such as LLPs, limited companies, and Licensed Bodies/ABSs), the minimum level of cover for any one claim must be at least £3 million.
Option A is incorrect; while £2 million is the floor for partnerships, it is not the standard for all firms; incorporated bodies have a higher threshold.
Option C is incorrect; while £5 million might be a prudent level of "top-up" cover for some firms, it is not the SRA-mandated statutory minimum.
Option D is incorrect; becoming an incorporated body increases the insurance requirement rather than decreasing it.
Option E is incorrect; the SRA minimum is a fixed regulatory floor based on entity type; it is not a variable figure calculated from fee income.

Question 35 (LEGAL SYSTEM)

A statute regulating public health states: “No person shall keep any dog in a designated public park unless such dog is on a lead.” Jeremy is in a public park with his dog, which is sitting obediently at his feet, not on a lead. A park warden issues him a fixed penalty notice. Jeremy challenges the notice, arguing his dog was under effective control and not moving, so he was not “keeping” it in the park in a manner contrary to the statute’s purpose.

Which approach to statutory interpretation would most likely assist Jeremy’s argument if the court wishes to avoid a potentially absurd result?
A. The literal rule
B.The golden rule
C. The direct rule
D. The purposive approach
F.The ejusdem generis rule

Correct Option: D

Explanation: Option D is correct. The purposive approach looks at the purpose of the legislation as a whole and interprets the words to give effect to that purpose. If the purpose is to ensure dogs are under control to prevent nuisance or danger, a dog sitting stationary and under voice control might not fall foul of the provision. This approach allows the court to avoid a literal interpretation that leads to an unreasonable result.
Option A is incorrect; the literal rule would give “keep” its plain meaning, which likely includes having a dog in one’s possession or charge, whether moving or not. This would not help Jeremy.
Option B is incorrect; the golden rule is a modification of the literal rule to avoid an absurd result. It could be used, but the purposive approach is the more modern and broader method for aligning interpretation with legislative intent.
Option C is incorrect; there is no such rule.
Option E is incorrect; there is no list of activities here to trigger the ejusdem generis rule.

Question 36 (LEGAL SERVICES)
Emma, a solicitor, acts for a politically exposed person from overseas in the purchase of a £5 million London property. The source of funds is a gift from a family member. Enhanced due diligence is completed. Two days before completion, the client informs Emma that the family member is now under formal investigation for corruption in their home country. Emma reports her suspicion to her firm’s Money Laundering Reporting Officer. The MLRO agrees a suspicious activity report must be made to the National Crime Agency .

What must the firm do in relation to the transaction after making the suspicious activity report?
A. Proceed with completion immediately, as the SAR has been filed and the firm has discharged its duty.
B. Seek consent from the NCA to proceed with the transaction and wait for the statutory notice period to expire or consent to be given.
C. Inform the client that the transaction is suspicious, they cannot proceed and cease acting immediately.
D. Proceed with completion after a waiting period of seven working days if no response is received from the NCA.
E. Notify the Solicitors Regulation Authority and await their guidance before proceeding.

Correct Option: B

Explanation: Option B is correct. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA), once a person has knowledge or suspicion of money laundering and makes an authorised disclosure (a SAR), they must not proceed with the transaction unless they obtain appropriate consent (a “defence against money laundering” consent). The NCA has seven working days (the “moratorium period”) to respond. If it refuses consent or does not respond within that period, the firm must wait a further 31 calendar days before it can proceed, unless consent is granted earlier.
Option A is incorrect; proceeding without consent constitutes a money laundering offence (tipping off or prejudicing an investigation).
Option C is incorrect; while ceasing to act is an option, it does not absolve the firm from the consent requirement if they are still involved in the transaction. Also, they must avoid tipping off the client.
Option D is incorrect; the waiting period is seven working days for the NCA’s initial response, but if they do not respond, the firm must wait the full 31 calendar days before proceeding, not just seven days.
Option E is incorrect; the primary legal obligation is to the NCA under POCA. While the SRA may need to be informed, this does not replace the statutory consent process.

Question 37 (BUSINESS LAW)

Widgets Ltd is a private company with 100,000 issued ordinary shares. Its articles incorporate the unamended model articles. The directors propose to issue 20,000 new ordinary shares to an external investor to raise capital. Sarah, an existing shareholder who holds 10,000 shares, objects. She argues the new issue unfairly dilutes her voting power and that the shares should first be offered to existing shareholders.

Which of the following best describes Sarah’s rights in this situation?
A. She has no statutory right to pre-emption because the model articles exclude such rights.
B. She can require the company to offer her 2,000 of the new shares before offering them to the external investor.
C. She can only challenge the issue if it is for an improper purpose, such as diluting her holding.
D.  She can require the company to offer her 5,000 of the new shares before offering them to the external investor.
E. She can require the company to offer her 20,000 of the new shares before offering them to the external investor..

Correct Option: B

Explanation: 

Explanation: Option B is correct. Under s.561 of the Companies Act 2006, existing shareholders have a statutory right of pre-emption on new issues of equity securities for cash. Sarah currently holds 10% of the issued share capital; therefore, she must be offered 10% of the 20,000 new shares (2,000 shares) on the same or more favorable terms before they can be issued to an outsider.
Option A is incorrect; the Model Articles do not automatically exclude statutory pre-emption rights. Exclusion requires a specific provision in the articles or a special resolution.
Option C is incorrect; while a "proper purpose" challenge (s.171) is a possible secondary claim if directors are acting in bad faith, it is not Sarah's only or primary right. Her primary right is the automatic statutory right to be offered the shares.
Option D is incorrect; this is a mathematical error. 5,000 shares would represent 25% of the new issue, but Sarah only owns 10% of the company and is thus only entitled to 10% of the new allotment.
Option E is incorrect; Sarah only has the right to maintain her pro rata (proportional) shareholding. She does not have the right to be offered the entire new issue unless she held 100% of the existing shares.

Question 38 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
You are a newly qualified solicitor at Parker & Co., representing a client in a fast-track trial for a £20,000 builder’s dispute in the County Court at Central London. The judge presiding is His Honour Judge Michael Arlington. This is your first contested trial as lead advocate. The hearing begins, and you stand to make your opening submissions. Nervous, and recalling television dramas, you begin by saying, "Your Worship, if it pleases the court, I appear for the claimant..." The judge, known for being a stickler for protocol but not unkind, interrupts you gently with a slight smile. He does not correct you aloud but raises an eyebrow, clearly expecting a different form of address. Your opponent, an experienced local solicitor, looks on.
What is the correct and expected form of address you should have used?
A. Your Honour
B. Sir
C. Judge
D. My Lord
E. Your Lordship
The correct option is A.
Explanation:
Option A is correct. In the County Court, a circuit judge (whose official title is "His/Her Honour Judge [Surname]") is addressed in open court as "Your Honour." "My Lord/Lady" or "Your Lordship/Ladyship" are reserved for High Court Judges and above. Using "My Lord" is a common rookie error. The judge’s reaction was a quiet prompt to use the proper address. Therefore, options B,C, D and E are incorrect.

Question 39 (LEGAL SYSTEM)
Sarah Adam is the General Counsel and Head of Legal for "Aerion Global," a multinational aerospace corporation. She is a qualified solicitor, holds a current practising certificate from the SRA, and is employed exclusively by Aerion. Aerion is the claimant in a £50 million breach of contract and confidentiality case in the Commercial Court (a specialist list within the High Court). The trial is set for three weeks. 
Sarah, who has not obtained her higher rights of advocacy, has an unparalleled command of the complex technical facts and the history of the contractual relationship. The board, seeking to control costs, has directed that Sarah represent the company at trial. Sarah appears before the trial judge on the first day to open the case. 
Can Sarah proceed with the case?
A. Sarah may proceed, as in-house solicitors have an automatic right to represent their employer in any court.
B. Sarah may not proceed, as the Commercial Court requires representation by an independent barrister in trials of this value.
C. Sarah may proceed only if she applies for and is granted temporary ad hoc rights of audience by the judge immediately.
D. Sarah may not proceed, as she lacks the higher rights of advocacy required to appear in the High Court.
E. Sarah may proceed only if external solicitors are also formally on the record to provide supervisory support.
The correct option is D.
Explanation:
Option D is correct. The critical factor is the court, not the employer. The Commercial Court is part of the High Court. A solicitor’s automatic rights of audience do not extend to the High Court; they must be extended by obtaining higher rights. Sarah’s status as an in-house solicitor is irrelevant to this procedural rule. The judge would be obliged to refuse her audience for the trial, which could lead to an adjournment and costs sanctions against Aerion. Therefore, options A, B, C and E are incorrect. 

Question 40 (BUSINESS LAW)
Under the articles of Zeta Consultancy Ltd, based on the Model Articles, any director may call a board meeting by giving notice to the other directors. A meeting takes place without notifying one director, Hana, who is currently abroad. The quorum of the meeting is met and the board approves a major contract. Hana challenges the validity of the meeting.
What is the correct legal position?
A.The meeting is invalid because all directors must be notified
B. The meeting is valid because the quorum was met, and notice to all directors is not required.
C. The meeting is invalid because a director abroad did not attend the meeting
C.The meeting is valid because the Model Articles permit retrospective approval at the next general meeting.
E. The meeting is invalid unless Hana later ratifies the board’s decision.
Explanation
Option A is correct.
Under Model Article 9, all directors must receive reasonable notice of board meetings. Failure to notify one director (even inadvertently) generally invalidates the meeting, unless that director waives the defect or the articles say otherwise.
Option B is incorrect: Quorum alone is not sufficient.
Option C is incorrect: The director’s physical location does not affect notice rights.
Option D is incorrect: There is no such mechanism in the Model Articles.
Option E is incorrect: Ratification is not required for invalidity, it simply remains invalid unless remedied.

Question 41 (Constitutional law)
A local authority installs high-resolution CCTV cameras that are capable of zooming into the windows of a residential building. The authority claims the cameras are necessary to deter anti-social behavior in the communal garden. A resident, who is a political activist, argues that the cameras allow the state to monitor their private movements inside their home without a warrant.
Which Convention Right under Schedule 1 of the HRA 1998 is most directly engaged by this surveillance?
A.Article 5
B.Article 8 
C.Article 10 
D.Article 11
E.Article 1 of the First Protocol 
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Article 8 protects the right to respect for private and family life, home, and correspondence. This includes protection from arbitrary surveillance by the state, especially when that surveillance intrudes upon the "home," which is a protected sphere under ECHR jurisprudence. 
Option A is incorrect. Article 5 protects against physical detention or arrest. 
Option C is incorrect. While the surveillance might have a "chilling effect" on the activist's speech, the most direct interference is with their privacy and home life. Option D is incorrect. Article 11 relates to the right to gather in groups and join organizations. 
Option E is incorrect. This relates to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (property rights), not the privacy within that property.

Question 42  (CONTRACT)

Leah is a singer and is planning a concert. She discovers that Eijah’s music hall is the most suitable for her concert as the hall has all the musical instruments she needs. She then contracts to hire Elijah's music hall for a major week-long event in three months' time and pays 50% of the hire fee in advance (£25,000).
Three weeks before the event, the music hall is completely destroyed by an electrical fire. The contract contains no clause covering this specific event. Leah seeks to recover the advance payment of £25,000.

What is the most likely outcome regarding Leah’s advance payment?

A. Leah can recover the full advance payment because James is in breach of contract for failing to renovate the hall after the fire.
B. Leah can recover from her insurance company.
C. Leah will recover the advance payment, but the court has discretion to allow Elijah to retain a sum to cover expenses he incurred before the fire for the purpose of the contract.
D. Leah cannot recover the advance payment because the risk of destruction lay with her as the hirer of the premises.
E. Leah will only recover the payment if she can prove that Elijah's lack of fire insurance caused her loss.

The correct option is C.

Explanation
Option C is correct. The destruction of the specific subject matter (the hall) causes frustration (Taylor v Caldwell). The Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943, s.1(2) governs the recovery of money paid in advance (Leah's £25,000). The Act permits recovery, but grants the court a discretion to allow the payee (Elijah) to retain or recover expenses incurred before the frustration, provided those expenses were incurred in or for the purpose of the contract.
Option B is incorrect as Leah does not have the obligation of insuring.
Option A is incorrect. Frustration discharges the contract; Elijah is not in breach.


Question 43 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
A group of trade union members wishes to hold a march through a city center to protest against wage stagnation. The Chief Constable of the local police force issues an order banning the march, citing a "moderate risk of traffic congestion and noise pollution," although there is no evidence of potential violence or disorder.
Which combination of Convention Rights is most relevant to the union members' challenge against the ban?
A.Article 2 and Article 3 
B. Article 8 and Article 9 
C. Article 10  and Article 11
D. Article 6  and Article 14 
E.  Article 5 and Article 1 of the First Protocol 
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. A public protest involves both the right to impart information and ideas (Article 10) and the right to gather peacefully with others (Article 11). Interference with a peaceful march for minor reasons like traffic congestion is often considered a disproportionate restriction on these qualified rights. Option A is incorrect. These are absolute rights regarding life and physical integrity. Option B is incorrect. While a protest expresses views, it is not primarily a matter of "private life" or religious practice. Option D is incorrect. Article 6 relates to court proceedings, not the right to protest. Option E is incorrect. Article 5 relates to physical arrest, and property rights are not the primary issue here.
Question 44 (BUSINESS LAW)

Titan Manufacturing Ltd prepares accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024. Its draft profit before tax is £620,000. Included within this figure are:

- Client entertaining expenses: £14,000
- Depreciation charge: £38,000
-A trade bad debt written off (irrecoverable): £6,500

The capital allowances for the year is £52,000

What is the company’s adjusted trading profit for corporation tax purposes?
A.£613,500
B.£585,500
C.  £641,500
D. £606,000
E. £620,000

Correct Answer: A £613,500

Explanation

Option A is correct

Add back disallowable expenses:

Client entertaining = disallowed → +£14,000


Depreciation = disallowed → +£38,000

Deduct allowable deductions:

Bad debt (trading, irrecoverable) → –£6,500


Capital allowances replace depreciation → –£52,000

Calculation:
£620,000 + £14,000 + £38,000 – £6,500 – £52,000 = £613,500

Option B is Incorrect because client entertaining must be added back, not deducted. Depreciation must be added back, not deducted. This option incorrectly adjusts allowable and disallowable items.

Option C is Incorrect because capital allowances should be deducted, not added. Depreciation should be added back, not removed.

Option D is Incorrect because it omits the client entertaining and bad debt adjustments, so it under-adjusts profit.

Question 45 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
You are acting for the claimant in a breach of contract trial listed for 3 days in the County Court. Your case relies heavily on the evidence of Mr. Aris, a former project manager for the defendant who witnessed the key discussions. Mr. Aris has provided a supportive witness statement but has now become reluctant to attend trial, telling you he "doesn't want to get involved" and fears repercussions from his former employer. You have explained his importance to the case, but he refuses to confirm his attendance. The deadline for notifying the court of witnesses has passed.
What is the most appropriate and immediate course of action to secure Mr. Aris's attendance at trial?
A. Apply to the court for an order that the defendant must ensure its former employee attends.
B. Notify the court that the witness is hostile and apply for permission to adduce his statement as hearsay evidence.
C. Apply to the court for the issue of a witness summons  to compel Mr. Aris's attendance.
D. Advise the client that without the witness's voluntary cooperation, this part of the case cannot be proved.
E. Wait until the trial and inform the judge, who can then order the witness to attend on the spot.
The correct option is C.
Explanation:
Option C is correct. Where a witness is reluctant, CPR Part 34 provides the mechanism for a party to obtain a witness summons from the court, which is an order compelling the witness to attend court to give evidence or produce documents. An application must be made, and a fee paid, in accordance with the rules. This is the standard and proper procedural tool in these circumstances.
Option A is incorrect. The court cannot order a party to compel a third party (especially a former employee) to attend; the mechanism is a witness summons against the witness personally.
Option B is incorrect. Treating the witness as hostile is a trial procedure for when a witness proves adverse during their evidence. His statement could be adduced as hearsay, but this is a less persuasive option than securing his live testimony, and an application would still be required.
Option D is incorrect. The law provides a mechanism (the witness summons) to overcome this precise problem.
Option E is incorrect. This is far too late and inefficient. The court expects parties to have secured their witnesses before the trial date.



Question 46 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

You act for a flooring supplier who has a judgment for £8,500 against a small limited company, "Kustom Kitchens Ltd." The company is still trading from a retail unit. Land Registry checks show the unit is leased. The company director has ignored all communications. You need a method of enforcement that can secure goods from the trade premises to satisfy the judgment.
Which of the following is the most direct and appropriate method?
A. Apply for a winding-up petition on the grounds of insolvency.
B. Apply to the court for the issue of a writ of control.
C. Apply for a third-party debt order against the company's main customer.
D. Apply for a charging order over the company's leasehold interest in the retail unit.
E. Apply for an oral examination of the company director.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. A writ of control (formerly a writ of fieri facias) is the standard method for enforcing a money judgment against a company's goods. An enforcement agent (bailiff) instructed under the writ can attend the trade premises, take control of goods belonging to the company, and sell them to raise money to satisfy the judgment debt and costs.
Option A is incorrect. A winding-up petition is a nuclear option to dissolve the company. It is a costly process for a £8,500 debt and is generally considered a last resort when other enforcement has failed or the company is insolvent.
Option C is incorrect. A third-party debt order freezes money owed to the judgment debtor by a third party (like a bank). It is not used to target money owed by a customer, which is a book debt requiring a different process.
Option D is incorrect. A charging order is usually sought against a beneficial interest in land. A leasehold may be targeted, but it is a slower process and less direct than seizing goods from a trading premises.
Option E is incorrect. An oral examination is for gathering information, not for enforcement itself. It could be a precursor but does not directly seize assets.


Question 47 (TORTS)
Noah, a factory worker, suffers a back injury as a result of his employer TechCorp Ltd’s negligence. He is expected to be absent from work for six months. Three months into his recovery, Noah is involved in an unrelated road traffic accident caused by a third party, Elijah. This second accident results in a far more serious neck injury that leaves Noah permanently disabled and unable ever to return to work. Noah brings a claim against TechCorp Ltd seeking compensation for all future losses arising from his total disability.
What is the extent of TechCorp Ltd’s liability for losses occurring after the second injury?
A. TechCorp Ltd and Elijah are jointly and severally liable for all losses arising from the permanent disability.
B. TechCorp Ltd is liable for all future losses, since the initial injury was a necessary factual cause of the eventual disability.
C. TechCorp Ltd’s liability for loss of earnings and related losses ends on the date of the second injury.
D. TechCorp Ltd is liable for the full six months of loss originally anticipated, but no more.
E. TechCorp Ltd remains liable for future loss, but subject to a 50% reduction to reflect the intervening event.
Correct answer: C
Explanation
Option C is correct. This is a classic Jobling v Associated Dairies scenario involving a supervening event caused by a third party that entirely overtakes the effect of the first tort. The second accident constitutes a novus actus interveniens, breaking the chain of causation for losses occurring after it. TechCorp Ltd is therefore liable only for the losses flowing from the original back injury up to the date of the second accident. Elijah, as the second tortfeasor, is responsible for the subsequent permanent disability and all later losses.
Option A is incorrect.
The injuries are sequential and independent; there is no basis for joint and several liability.
Option B is incorrect.
Factual causation is not enough: legal causation is broken by the intervening accident.
Option D is incorrect.
Liability ends at the date of the second injury, which occurred before the six-month recovery period would have concluded.
Option E is incorrect.
This is not a case for apportionment. The second injury replaces, rather than overlaps with, the effects of the first.

Question 48 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

Oliver issues a claim form against Neptune Retail Ltd. He attempts to serve it by emailing the defendant’s general enquiries address, even though the defendant has not provided written consent to accept service by email. No other steps are taken. The four-month period for service expires. Oliver applies for an extension, arguing that email is widely accepted and Neptune undoubtedly received the claim.
What is the likely outcome?
A. Service is valid because the email was received.
B. Service is invalid because email service requires written consent.
C. The court will validate service retrospectively because the defendant suffered no prejudice.
D. The court must extend time automatically because service was attempted.
E. Service is valid because the general enquiries address counts as the principal office.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation
B is correct: Under CPR 6.3 and PD 6A, email service is only valid with prior written consent. Sending to a general enquiries address without consent is invalid.
A is incorrect: Receipt does not cure invalid service.
C is incorrect: The court has no general discretion to “cure” invalid service after expiry of the period (see Barton).
D is incorrect: Extensions are discretionary and rarely granted where the claimant has failed to take reasonable steps.
E is incorrect: Emailing a generic address does not constitute valid service on a company.

Question 49 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
A sole practitioner in a rural conveyancing practice is approached by a long-standing client who is experiencing severe financial distress and urgently wishes to sell a large plot of agricultural land immediately to raise liquid capital to service outstanding debts. The client, who trusts the solicitor implicitly after years of professional service, offers to sell the land to the solicitor privately for a fixed price that the solicitor knows, based on recent comparable sales in the area, is approximately twenty percent below the current open market value for arable land in that specific county. 
The solicitor is personally interested in acquiring the land for a future self-build residential project they are planning and believes that purchasing it would assist the client in resolving their debt issues quickly without the delay of marketing the property through an agent. The solicitor intends to proceed with the purchase and plans to suggest that the client signs a document confirming they are happy with the predetermined price and explicitly waive their right to seek independent valuation or legal advice, thereby expediting the conveyance process.
Which of the following statements accurately reflects the solicitor's professional position regarding the proposed purchase of the land?
A. The solicitor must decline to act in the transaction because proceeding would constitute a conflict of interest which cannot be cured by client consent.
B. The solicitor may proceed with the purchase provided the client is advised in writing to seek independent legal advice and signs a waiver confirming they have declined to do so.
C. The solicitor may proceed with the purchase if they pay the full market value for the land, thereby removing any financial disadvantage to the client.
D. The solicitor acts properly provided they disclose their personal interest in the land and the client provides written informed consent to the transaction.
E. The solicitor must decline to act unless the client is represented by a different firm, in which case the solicitor can continue to act for themselves in the purchase.
The correct option is A.
Explanation 
Option A is correct because this scenario presents an "own interest conflict" where the solicitor's personal interest in acquiring the land at a favorable price conflicts with their professional duty to act in the client's best interests (securing the best price). The Solicitors Regulation Authority regulations treat own interest conflicts as absolute prohibitions that cannot be cured by informed consent or waivers, meaning the solicitor must not act in the transaction at all.
Option B is incorrect because suggesting the client waive independent advice exacerbates the breach of duty, and even if the client received advice, the solicitor cannot act where an own interest conflict exists.
Option C is incorrect because paying market value does not resolve the conflict of interest inherent in the solicitor acting as both advisor and purchaser; the solicitor's independence is compromised regardless of the price.
Option D is incorrect because informed consent is not a valid exception for an own interest conflict; the prohibition is strict to prevent the exploitation of the fiduciary relationship.
Option E is incorrect because the solicitor cannot "act for themselves" in a way that involves exploiting the knowledge gained from the client; while they could buy the land as a private individual if the client is independently represented, they cannot "act" in the professional sense of the retainer.


Question 50 (LEGAL SERVICES)

Adam, a solicitor, acts on the purchase of a commercial property for his client, Elijah, for £1.5 million. Elijah has an opaque financial history and insists on paying the purchase price by depositing £10,000 daily into James's client account from various unknown bank branches over a five-month period. Elijah claims this is cash that he has held over many years. Adam is highly suspicious that the funds may be the proceeds of crime.
What is Adam's primary mandatory legal obligation under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) in this scenario?
A. Adam must immediately seek approval from the National Crime Agency (NCA) to continue acting.
B. Adam must advise Elijah that he is legally obliged to report the source of funds to HMRC.
C. Adam must make an internal Suspicious Activity Report to his firm's Money Laundering Reporting Officer as soon as practicable.
D. Adam must immediately resign from the retainer because proceeding would constitute the commission of a money laundering offence.
E. Adam must inform Elijah that he is not comfortable with the arrangement and we will need to to carry out EDD.
The correct option is C.

Explanation

Option C is correct. Under POCA s.330 (Failure to Disclose), a solicitor operating in the regulated sector who knows or suspects that another person is engaged in money laundering is under a mandatory legal obligation to make an authorized disclosure. The proper and primary step is to make an internal Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) to the firm's designated MLRO as soon as practicable.
Option A is incorrect. Reporting to the NCA is the responsibility of the MLRO, following the internal SAR; it is not the solicitor's primary mandatory step.
Option E is  incorrect. While EDD may be required under the Money Laundering Regulations 2017, the POCA duty to report the suspicion takes precedence over continuing with client due diligence, as proceeding without consent could constitute "tipping off" or facilitating money laundering.
Option D is incorrect. The solicitor must first report to the MLRO; continuing to act may be permissible if the MLRO (and subsequently the NCA) grants consent.

Question 51 (BUSINESS LAW)

A VAT-registered law firm, “Legal Eagles LLP”, bills a corporate client £12,000 for legal services. This fee is shown on the invoice as “Fees: £10,000 + VAT: £2,000”. The firm pays £600 in VAT on stationery and other office supplies purchased in the same period.
What is the net amount of VAT that Legal Eagles LLP must pay to HMRC for this period?
A. £600
B. £1,400
C. £2,000
D. £2,600
E. £12,000
B is the correct option.
Explanation
B is correct. The firm charges £2,000 in Output Tax (VAT on its sales) and has paid £600 in Input Tax (VAT on its purchases). The net VAT payable to HMRC is Output Tax minus Input Tax: £2,000 - £600 = £1,400.
A is incorrect as this is the Input Tax amount, which is reclaimed.
C is incorrect as this is the total Output Tax, ignoring the reclaimable Input Tax.
D is incorrect as this is the sum of Output and Input Tax, not the net amount.
E is incorrect as this is the total invoice value including VAT, which is not the VAT payment.
Question 52 (BUSINESS LAW)

Samuel is the sole director of TechCorp Ltd, a private company that has adopted the Model Articles (MAs). Samuel wishes to enter into a new fixed-term service contract with the company for a period of seven years.

Which shareholder approval procedure is required to validly authorize this service contract?

A. The service contract requires a Special Resolution of the shareholders to be passed.
B. The service contract is validly authorized by a simple Board Resolution passed by Samuel as the sole director.
C. The service contract is void unless it is approved by an Ordinary Resolution of the shareholders.
D. The service contract is validly authorized by an Ordinary Resolution of the shareholders, but only for a maximum of five years.
E. The service contract is automatically void as it exceeds the statutory maximum of two years.
The correct option is C.

Explanation

Option C is correct. Under s.188 Companies Act 2006, a company cannot enter into a contract under which a director's employment is guaranteed for a fixed term of more than two years, unless the terms are first approved by an Ordinary Resolution of the company's members. Since Samuel's contract is for seven years (more than two), it requires shareholder approval by Ordinary Resolution. If the OR is not passed, the excess term (the five years beyond the first two) is unenforceable against the company.

Option A is incorrect: While a company could choose to use a Special Resolution, the statutory minimum required by the CA 2006 for this specific transaction is an Ordinary Resolution.
Option B is incorrect: A sole director cannot bypass the requirement for shareholder approval for a long-term contract. Even if Samuel is the sole shareholder, he must still technically pass a shareholder resolution (even if it's just him signing a written resolution) to comply with the Act.
Option D is incorrect: This confuses the law. Under the older Companies Act 1985, the limit was five years, but the 2006 Act reduced this to two years. There is no "five-year" maximum for the resolution itself; an Ordinary Resolution can authorize a contract of any length (e.g., 7, 10, or 20 years). 
Option E is incorrect: The contract is not "automatically void" in its entirety. Only the specific term providing the seven-year guarantee is void. The rest of the contract (salary, duties, etc.) remains valid, but the company gains the right to terminate him on reasonable notice.
Question 53 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)

Sarah Jenkins is preparing the key witness for a claimant in a professional negligence trial. The witness, Mr. Davies, is an accountant whose evidence is central to quantifying the loss. Sarah holds a conference with Mr. Davies where she shows him a draft of his witness statement. He confirms it is accurate. She then says, "Now, I'm going to play devil's advocate. The other side's barrister will be very aggressive. He will likely suggest that your calculation method in section 4 is flawed because it doesn't account for market volatility. How would you respond to that?"

 Mr. Davies looks confused and says he doesn't know. Sarah then says, "Well, the best response is to refer to the industry standard guidelines published in 2020, which specifically endorse your methodology. You should mention those if this challenge comes up."

What is the primary ethical problem with Sarah's preparation of the witness?

●A. There is no problem; she is properly preparing the witness for cross-examination by alerting him to likely challenges and suggesting effective responses.
●B. She is improperly coaching the witness by supplying him with specific answers and legal arguments that he did not independently recall or possess
●C. She has breached confidentiality by revealing her litigation strategy and the other side's potential arguments to a third-party witness.
●D. She should not have shown the witness his own draft statement, as this contaminates his pure recollection of events.
●E. The problem is that she did this without a barrister present; witness preparation should always be conducted by or with counsel.

The correct answer is option B

Explanation

The correct answer is B. The line between ethical witness preparation and improper coaching is crossed when the solicitor moves from testing the witness's own knowledge to supplying them with new information, arguments, or specific phrases to use. Here, Sarah is not just testing Mr. Davies; she is giving him the "correct" answer, the 2020 guidelines, which he did not previously know or mention. This is scripting his evidence. The witness's testimony should be his own independent recollection and understanding. By feeding him this specific legal reference, Sarah is distorting the evidence he will give, making it her construction rather than his own. This undermines the integrity of the trial process.

Option A is incorrect. While preparing a witness for the nature of cross-examination is acceptable, providing them with specific content and arguments is not. The preparation should be about the process and testing the witness's own knowledge, not about furnishing them with new material.

Option C is incorrect. There is no general duty of confidentiality owed to the other side regarding trial strategy when preparing your own witness. The ethical breach is related to the integrity of the witness's evidence, not confidentiality.

Option D is incorrect. It is standard and proper practice to show a witness their draft statement to ensure its accuracy. This does not, in itself, contaminate recollection; it helps to ensure the statement is a true record.

Option E is Incorrect. While counsel often leads advocacy, solicitors are perfectly entitled to, and often do, conduct witness preparation. The ethical rules apply equally to both.

Question  54 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
Daniel Harper represents a defendant who has pleaded guilty to a serious assault. The Probation Service's pre-sentence report recommends a custodial sentence. The defendant, desperate to avoid prison, begs Daniel to "tell the court anything" to get a non-custodial sentence. The defendant mentions,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        in passing, that he has been volunteering at a local youth club, but has no proof. Daniel investigates and finds this is untrue; the youth club has no record of him. In his mitigation plea before the judge, Daniel is considering how to handle this. He feels a strong duty to his client but knows he cannot mislead the court.

What must Daniel absolutely avoid doing in his mitigation speech?

●A. He can state that his client "has expressed a sincere desire to contribute positively to his community, for example by working with youth," as this reflects the client's stated aspiration, not a factual claim.
●B. He must avoid any mention of the youth club whatsoever, as he knows the claim is false,.
●C. He can state that his client "has been involved in youth work," relying on the client's instructions, as he is not required to verify every assertion his client makes.
●D. He should tell the court that his client claims to have done youth work but that this has not been verified, thereby passing the responsibility for the truthfulness of the claim to the judge.
●E. He should apply for an adjournment to investigate the youth work claim properly, even though he already knows the answer.

The correct answer is option B

Explanation
Option B is correct A solicitor, as an officer of the court, must not make a submission to the court that they know to be false or misleading. This is a paramount duty. Daniel *knows* the claim about the youth club is untrue. Therefore, he cannot make any statement that asserts or implies it is true. To do so would be a deliberate deception of the court in a matter material to sentencing, which is a very serious disciplinary offence. His duty to the client does not extend to presenting falsehoods.

Option A is incorrect. This is a disingenuous use of language that is designed to create a false impression in the judge's mind. The phrasing "for example by working with youth" clearly implies that this is an actual example of past or current conduct, not a mere aspiration. It is a deliberate attempt to mislead without technically lying, and it is a breach of integrity.

Option C is incorrect. The duty to the court overrides the duty to follow client instructions. A solicitor is not a mere mouthpiece. If they know an instruction is to present a falsehood, they must refuse. The "not required to verify" principle applies to situations of uncertainty, not to situations of certain knowledge of falsity.

Option D is incorrect. This is an unacceptable halfway house. Making the statement but adding a caveat does not cleanse the act. He is still putting a known falsehood before the court. The only ethical course is to not mention it at all.

Option E is incorrect. This is a charade and a waste of court time. He already knows the claim is false. Applying for an adjournment to "investigate" a fact he has already verified would itself be misleading the court about his reasons for seeking the adjournment.



Question 55 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
Jonathan Reed is a partner at a firm representing a wealthy environmental activist group. The group's stated goal is to halt a large infrastructure project. They instruct Jonathan to file judicial review claims against multiple minor planning permissions and environmental permits granted to the project, not because they have strong legal merits, but because the cumulative effect of defending multiple claims will cause significant delay and cost for the developer, potentially making the project financially unviable.

The group's director tells Jonathan, "We don't need to win every case, just make this so painful and expensive for them that they walk away." Jonathan knows that while each claim has a superficial legal argument, their primary purpose is delay and financial pressure, not a genuine belief in their legal validity.

What is Jonathan's primary ethical obligation in this situation?

●A. He must file the claims as instructed, as his duty is to act in the client's best interests, and this is a legitimate litigation strategy to achieve the client's goals.
●B. He must advise the client that it is an abuse of the court's process,
●C. He should file the claims but ensure each one is drafted to appear as strong as possible, thereby fulfilling his duty to the client while meeting his duty to the court by presenting valid legal arguments.
●D. He should agree to file only the one or two claims that have the strongest legal merit, thereby serving the client's broader goal while staying within ethical boundaries.
●E. He must report the client's intentions to the other side's solicitors to ensure they are aware of the ulterior motive behind the litigation.

The correct answer is option B

Explanation 
Option B is correct. A solicitor must not use their professional position to facilitate an abuse of the court's process. Issuing claims without a genuine intention to pursue them to a judgment on their merits, but rather for an ulterior purpose like inflicting commercial damage through delay, is a classic abuse of process. Jonathan's duty to the court overrides his duty to follow these client instructions. He must provide candid advice to the client that this strategy is improper and that he cannot be a party to it. Filing such claims would breach his duty under Principle 1 to uphold the administration of justice.

Option A is incorrect. The duty to the client is not absolute. A solicitor cannot facilitate an abuse of process, regardless of the client's objectives. This strategy corrupts the proper function of the legal system.

Option C is incorrect. This is duplicitous. Dressing up claims to "appear" strong does not change their fundamental purpose, which is abusive. The solicitor's knowledge of the ulterior motive is the key factor, not the superficial quality of the pleadings.

Option D is incorrect. This is a compromise that still makes the solicitor complicit in the abusive strategy. Even filing one claim for an improper purpose is unethical. The number of claims is irrelevant to the fundamental issue of intent.

Option E is incorrect. This would be a gross breach of confidentiality owed to the client. The solicitor's duty is to refuse to act on the instructions, not to betray the client's confidence to the opponent.

Question 56 (BUSINESS LAW)

Edinburgh FinTech Start-Up Ltd" has just appointed a new director, Ms. Anya Khan, to its board to enhance its digital strategy. The company secretary, Mr. Davies, is now processing the administrative tasks that follow a valid board appointment. He is reviewing the company's obligations under the Companies Act 2006 to ensure full compliance. He knows that there are strict timelines for updating both internal statutory registers and the public record held by the Registrar of Companies. Failure to meet these deadlines could result in the company and every officer in default being liable for a fine.

What are the two primary statutory filing and registration requirements that Edinburgh FinTech Start-Up Ltd must fulfil following the appointment of Ms. Khan as a director?

●A. The company must file a Form AP01 with Companies House within 14 days and simultaneously update its own internal Register of Directors.
●B. The company must file a Form AP01 with Companies House within 28 days and simultaneously update its own internal Register of Directors.
●C. The company must file a Form AP01 with Companies House within 21 days and simultaneously update its own internal Register of Directors..
●D. The company must file a Form SH01 to update its share capital and issue a press release announcing the new appointment to comply with market abuse regulations.
●E. The company must seek approval from the Company Directors Disqualification Unit to ensure Ms. Khan is not disqualified and then file a Form AP01 within 21 days.

The correct answer is option A

Explanation 

Option A is correct.  This precisely states the two core requirements. The text confirms that following an appointment, the company has a "statutory duty to notify Companies House. The required Form AP01 (for an individual) must be filed within 14 days of the appointment." Simultaneously, "the company must update its own internal Register of Directors." These are distinct but parallel duties: one external (filing with the state), one internal (maintaining the company's own records). Therefore B and C are incorrect.

Option D is incorrect. A Form SH01 is for the return of allotment of shares, which is unrelated to the appointment of a director. Furthermore, as a private "Start-Up Ltd," it is unlikely to be subject to market abuse regulations, which primarily apply to publicly traded companies.
Option E is incorrect. There is no requirement to seek approval from the Company Directors Disqualification Unit before appointing a director. It is the responsibility of the company and the individual to ensure they are not disqualified. The filing deadline for Form AP01 is 14 days, not 21 days.

Question 57 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
A lone protestor, Aaron, stands silently outside a government building holding a large, graphic placard depicting images from a conflict zone. The images are disturbing but accurate. A small crowd gathers, and heated debates begin. Two members of the public, incensed by the placard, begin shouting aggressively at Aaron, threatening to "rip that sign apart" and "make him eat it." 
Their agitation spreads, and others start jostling. A police officer on duty believes a violent altercation is imminent. To prevent this, the officer approaches Aaron and tells him he must lower the placard or leave the area for his own safety. Aaron refuses, stating he is doing nothing unlawful. The officer then arrests Aaron for an anticipated breach of the peace.
Was the officer's pre-emptive arrest of Aaron lawful?

A. No, because Aaron's own conduct was peaceful and non-threatening.
B. Yes, because the officer reasonably believed a breach of the peace was imminent.
C. No, because the threat came from others, so they should have been arrested instead.
D. Yes, because displaying graphic images in public is inherently provocative.
E. No, because a breach of the peace requires actual violence, not a mere threat.
The correct answer is option B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The common law power to arrest to prevent an imminent breach of the peace is well-established (R (Laporte) v Chief Constable of Gloucestershire). The key is whether the officer reasonably believes a breach of the peace (harm to persons or property, or fear thereof) is about to occur. Here, the aggressive threats from the crowd and the jostling created a situation where violence was likely. The arrest of the person whose presence is the catalyst for the threat can be lawful to prevent that violence, even if that person is not themselves violent.
Option A is incorrect. While Aaron's conduct may be lawful, the power to prevent a breach of the peace can extend to arresting a person whose lawful conduct is inadvertently triggering imminent violence from others, if their removal is necessary to prevent it.
Option C is incorrect. The officer could also arrest the threatening individuals. However, the law allows for the arrest of the person whose continued presence is the cause of the imminent disturbance if removing them is a reasonable and proportionate way to prevent the violence. The officer has a discretion as to the most effective way to quell the imminent threat.
Option D is incorrect. The lawfulness of the arrest does not hinge on the placard being "inherently provocative." The test is the officer's reasonable belief about imminent violence, not a subjective judgment about the content of the protest.
Option E is incorrect. The common law concept of a breach of the peace encompasses conduct where harm is likely to occur, not just where it has already occurred. The power is preventative.
Question 58 (Professional Ethics)
A solicitor is representing a client, Sarah, who is claiming damages for a whiplash injury following a car accident. Sarah tells her solicitor in a private meeting: "The pain is quite bad, but to be honest, I managed to go skiing last month. It hurt a bit, but I didn't want to miss the holiday."
The solicitor later receives a Witness Statement drafted by a junior colleague for Sarah to sign. The statement says: "Since the accident, I have been unable to participate in any sporting activities or holidays due to the constant pain."Sarah is happy to sign it as it "strengthens her case."
What is the solicitor’s correct course of action?
A. The solicitor must immediately inform the defendant’s solicitors that Sarah went skiing.
B. The solicitor must inform the court that Sarah is committing perjury and withdraw from the case.
C. The solicitor must refuse to file the statement and advise Sarah that it must be amended to reflect the skiing trip, or they can no longer act for her.
D. The solicitor should file the statement as drafted because Sarah is prepared to sign it, and the solicitor’s primary duty is to act in the client's best interests.
E. The solicitor can file the statement but must ensure they do not mention the skiing trip during the trial cross-examination.
The Correct Answer: C
Explanation: This scenario tests SRA Code of Conduct Rule 1.4: “You do not mislead or attempt to mislead the court...” and Rule 2.1: “You do not bypass your obligations to the court in the interests of your client.” A solicitor cannot be "complicit" in a client's lie. If you know a document is false, you cannot file it. However, because of Legal Professional Privilege, you cannot immediately "snitch" on your client to the other side (which is why A and B are wrong). You must first give the client the chance to correct the lie. If they refuse, you must cease to act (withdraw) because you can no longer fulfill your duty to the court without breaching your duty of confidentiality.
Option D is incorrect. Your duty to the court is paramount. It overrides the "best interests of the client" if the client wants to deceive the court.
Option E is incorrect. Filing a document you know to be false is a "positive act" of misleading the court. Waiting until the trial to be "quiet" is not enough to satisfy your ethical obligations.
Question 59 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
During a night of widespread civil unrest, a group of 15 people armed with bricks and bottles move through a retail district. They act in a coordinated manner, simultaneously smashing the windows of ten adjacent shops and loot the contents. Their actions are accompanied by loud, aggressive chanting. The scene causes immense terror; witnesses report feeling they were witnessing a "complete breakdown of order." Prosecutors are considering the most serious public order charge.
Which element most critically distinguishes the offence of riot from violent disorder in this scenario?
A. The number of persons involved exceeds twelve.
B. The use or threat of unlawful violence.
C. The common purpose of the persons present.
D. That a person of reasonable firmness would fear for their safety.
E. The level of terror caused to the witnesses.
The correct answer is option C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Under s.1(1) of the Public Order Act 1986, the offence of riot requires that the persons present use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose. This element of a shared, common purpose is the key conceptual distinction from violent disorder (s.2), which requires only that three or more persons are present together using violence. The coordinated, simultaneous attack on multiple properties strongly indicates a pre-meditated common purpose.
Option A is incorrect. While riot requires twelve or more persons, this is a necessary condition but not the distinguishing element in the context of the scenario. Violent disorder only requires three. Both thresholds are met here.
Option B is incorrect. The use of unlawful violence is a required element for both riot and violent disorder. It does not distinguish between the two offences.
Option D is incorrect. Causing a person of reasonable firmness to fear for their personal safety is an element of violent disorder (s.2(1)) and affray (s.3). For riot, the required mental element is that the defendants intend to use violence or are aware that their conduct may be violent (s.1(1) and (6)). The terror caused is evidence, but not the defining legal criterion.
Option E is incorrect. The level of terror is a factual consequence, not a statutory element that legally distinguishes riot from other offences. Both riot and violent disorder can cause extreme terror.

Question 60 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
For twenty years, a local council has granted a peace group permission to hold a small annual vigil in the town's war memorial garden. The permission has always been granted via a standard-form letter. This year, a new council leader, who disagrees with the group's message, refuses the permission without explanation. The council's published policy states that decisions on event permissions will be "fair and consistent." The group seeks judicial review, arguing they had a legitimate expectation that permission would be granted.
What must the court primarily consider to determine if a substantive legitimate expectation exists?
A. Whether the council's new decision was Wednesday unreasonable.
B. Whether the group had a clear and unambiguous assurance from the council, on which they relied.
C. Whether the council has the absolute statutory power to grant or refuse permission.
D. Whether the group's vigil constitutes a lawful public assembly under the Public Order Act.
E. Whether the council leader acted with personal malice or bias.
The correct answer is option B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. To establish a substantive legitimate expectation (that a certain outcome will occur), the claimant must show: 1) a clear and unambiguous assurance/practice from the public authority, and 2) reliance on that assurance. The twenty-year consistent practice of granting permission, likely coupled with the "fair and consistent" policy, could found such an expectation. The court would then weigh this expectation against any overriding public interest reasons for the council's change of policy.
Option A is incorrect. The Wednesday standard may be part of the overall review, but the specific doctrine of legitimate expectation creates a distinct legal analysis focused on the fairness of frustrating an expectation, not just the rationality of the decision.
Option C is incorrect. The existence of a statutory power is a prerequisite, but it does not answer the fairness question raised by the legitimate expectation. A power must be exercised fairly, which includes honouring promises and consistent practices where appropriate.
Option D is incorrect. Whether the assembly is lawful is a separate question. The claim is based on the fairness of the administrative decision-making process, not the legality of the group's proposed actions.
Option E is incorrect. Malice or bias could make a decision unlawful on other grounds, but it is not a necessary element for a claim based on legitimate expectation, which is rooted in the principles of fairness and consistency.


Question 61 (CONTRACT)
Mr. Alistair Finch was browsing in "The Vintage Watch Emporium," a high-end jewellers. In a locked glass cabinet, a tag next to a rare Patek Philippe watch clearly stated "Price: £25,000." Mr. Finch informed a shop assistant, "I'd like to buy this watch for the advertised price of £25,000." The assistant apologised and explained that the tag was outdated and the correct price was £35,000, due to a recent surge in the watch's market value. 
Mr. Finch insisted that the displayed price was a firm offer which he had accepted, creating a binding contract. The manager supported the assistant, refusing to sell at £25,000. 
Did Mr. Finch's statement to the assistant form a binding contract to purchase the watch for £25,000?
A.Yes , the displayed price was a definite offer.
B. Yes , it was a unilateral offer accepted by tendering money.
C. No, display of the watch is an invitation to treat.
D. No,  the price correction revoked the offer before acceptance.
E. No, the shop had not accepted Mr. Finch’s offer.
The correct answer is option C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The display of the watch with a price tag was an invitation to treat. Mr. Finch made the offer when he expressed his willingness to buy it for £25,000. The shop was free to reject this offer, which it did by stating the correct price.
Option A is incorrect. The foundational principle in English law is that the display of goods is an invitation to treat, not an offer. This was established in Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists and applies to shop displays.
Option B is incorrect. A unilateral offer is a promise in return for an act (e.g., a reward). A shop display is not construed as such an offer; it is an invitation for customers to make offers.
Option D is incorrect. As the display was not an offer, there was nothing to revoke. The legal analysis turns on the classification of the display as an invitation to treat.
Option E is incorrect. It accurately states that Mr. Finch was the offeror, and the shop, as the offeree, had not yet accepted his offer.
Question 62 (CONTRACT)
"DataSecure Ltd." sent a draft services agreement to "CloudNine Consultants" via email. The draft contained a clause stating, "This agreement shall be deemed accepted by CloudNine unless we receive a written notice of objection within 7 days of the date of this email." The managing director of CloudNine read the email and agreed with the terms, so he deliberately decided not to respond, believing his silence would constitute acceptance as per the clause. After the 7-day period, DataSecure heard nothing and proceeded to allocate resources to the project. A week later, CloudNine received a better offer and informed DataSecure that no contract existed because they had never communicated acceptance. Was a binding contract formed by CloudNine's silence after the 7-day period?
A. Yes,  the offeror stipulated silence as acceptance.
B. Yes, internal intention plus inaction creates a contract.
C. No, an offeror cannot impose acceptance by silence.
D. No ,acceptance requires positive communication.
E. No , the 7-day period was unreasonably short.
The correct answer is option C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. This is a direct application of the principle in Felthouse v Bindley. An offeror cannot stipulate that silence will constitute acceptance. Acceptance must be communicated positively.
Option A is incorrect. An offeror cannot unilaterally impose terms that force the offeree to act to avoid a contract. This would be an onerous burden on the offeree.
Option B is incorrect. The subjective intention of the offeree is irrelevant if it is not communicated. Contract formation is governed by the objective test.
Option D is incorrect. While silence alone cannot accept, acceptance can be inferred from conduct. However, the principle in Felthouse specifically prevents an offeror from prescribing silence as the method of acceptance.
Option E is incorrect. The reasonableness of the time period is not the central legal issue. The fundamental problem is the attempt to use silence as a method of acceptance.
Question 63 (CONTRACT)
The local council posted notices across a public park: "A reward of £500 is offered for information leading to the identification and successful prosecution of persons vandalising park property. Informants may choose to remain anonymous." A regular park user, Mrs. Anya Sharma, witnessed a group of teenagers damaging a bench and sensed that they were the vandals the council was talking about. Using her phone, she discreetly recorded a clear video of their faces and them committing the act. She immediately emailed the video to the council's dedicated enforcement office from a newly created, anonymous email account, with no message in the body. The video was used as key evidence to convict the teenagers. Mrs. Sharma later came forward to claim the reward. Is Mrs. Sharma entitled to the £500 reward from the council?
A. No, she failed to communicate her acceptance.
B. No, claiming the reward contradicted the anonymous terms.
C. Yes, providing the information was acceptance of the unilateral offer.
D. Yes, if she proves she knew of the reward beforehand.
E. No, offers to the public cannot bind a specific individual.
The correct answer is option C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The council's notice was a unilateral offer. The requested act was providing information leading to prosecution. Mrs. Sharma performed this act in full by supplying the decisive video evidence. A contract was formed at that point (Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.).
Option A is incorrect. In a unilateral contract, acceptance is through full performance of the requested act, not a prior communication of an intention to accept. Providing the information was the performance.
Option B is incorrect. The offer allowed for anonymity in the provision of information. Coming forward later to claim the reward is a separate step and does not invalidate the prior acceptance by performance.
Option D is incorrect. She must have acted in reliance on the offer. However, the scenario implies she was a regular park user, and the primary reason for entitlement is her performance of the act.
Option E is incorrect. A unilateral offer can be made to the whole world, and it is accepted by any person who performs the required condition.
Question 64 (CONTRACT)
"SturdyBuild Ltd." sent a purchase order to "Quality Steel Co." for 50 steel beams, using SturdyBuild's standard terms which included a clause limiting their liability for late payment. Quality Steel responded with an "Order Confirmation" on their own paperwork, which stated, "Thank you for your order. This confirmation is based on our Standard Terms and Conditions, a copy of which is available on request," and which contained a clause imposing interest on late payments at 8%. 
No further documents were signed or exchanged. Quality Steel delivered the beams, and SturdyBuild used them in a construction project but paid the invoice two months late. Quality Steel is now demanding interest. On whose standard terms, those of SturdyBuild or Quality Steel, was the contract formed?
A. SturdyBuild’s, their purchase order was the initial offer.
B. SturdyBuild’s , Quality Steel accepted by delivering the goods.
C. Quality Steel’s, their confirmation was a counter-offer accepted by taking delivery.
D. Quality Steel’s, their terms were the most reasonable and fair..
E. Void, the conflicting terms show no meeting of minds.
The correct answer is option C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. This applies the "last shot" doctrine. SturdyBuild's purchase order was an offer. Quality Steel's confirmation, containing different terms (8% interest), was a counter-offer. SturdyBuild accepted this counter-offer by taking delivery of and using the beams, thereby forming a contract on Quality Steel's terms.
Option A is incorrect. In the "battle of the forms," the first shot does not usually win. The analysis focuses on the last document exchanged before performance.
Option B is incorrect. By sending a document with different terms, Quality Steel did not accept SturdyBuild's offer but made a counter-offer.
Option E is incorrect. The courts will strive to find a contract where the parties have acted as if one exists. The "last shot" doctrine provides a legal mechanism to resolve the conflict and find agreement.
Question 65 (CONTRACT)
"QuickResponse IT" sent a fax to a client, "Global Logistics," offering urgent IT support for a fixed fee of £2,000. The fax ended, "Please confirm acceptance by return fax to mobilise our team immediately." The IT manager at Global Logistics typed a confirmation letter and sent it via first-class post, assuming it was more formal. The letter arrived two days later. Meanwhile, QuickResponse IT, having received no fax, assumed the offer was rejected and took on another client. Global Logistics suffered an IT crash and is now suing QuickResponse for breach of contract, claiming their postal acceptance was effective.
 Was a binding contract formed when Global Logistics posted their letter of acceptance?
A. Yes, the postal rule applies upon posting.
B. Yes, they used a reasonable alternative method.
C. No,they failed to use the prescribed method of acceptance.
D. No, acceptance was not received before the offer lapsed.
E. No, urgency implied an instantaneous method was required.
The correct answer is option C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The general rule is that an offeror may prescribe the method by which their offer must be accepted. If they do so, the offeree must comply with that method for a valid acceptance to occur. The wording "Please confirm acceptance by return fax" is a clear stipulation of a specific method.  The principle is supported by case law, such as Financings Ltd v Stimson [1962] 1 WLR 1184, which confirms that an offeror is the master of their offer and can dictate the terms of acceptance. While some cases (e.g., Yates Building Co Ltd v RJ Pulleyn & Sons (York) Ltd (1975) 237 EG 183) suggest that a prescribed method is not necessarily exclusive if it is simply for the offeror's benefit, the wording here, combined with the context of urgency ("to mobilise our team immediately"), strongly indicates that using the fax was intended as a mandatory condition for forming a contract. By choosing a slower, non-stipulated method (post), Global Logistics failed to accept effectively.
Option A is incorrect. The postal rule is a default rule that can be displaced by the offeror specifying a different method. The words "by return fax" indicate a prescribed method.
Option B is incorrect. The test is whether the offeree complied with the offeror's requirements, not whether the method used was reasonable.
Option D is incorrect. The legal reason is the failure to use the stipulated method, not merely that it arrived late.
Option E is incorrect. While the urgency supports the requirement for a fast method, the legal reason is the specific prescription of the method, not the implication.

Question 66 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
David, a homeowner, brought a claim in the County Court against Jasper Construction Ltd for professional negligence following a botched basement extension. Because the claim involved complex engineering evidence and was valued at £75,000, the case was allocated to the Multi-Track.
The trial lasted three days and was heard by His Honour Judge (HHJ) Miller, a Circuit Judge. At the conclusion of the trial, HHJ Miller delivered a final judgment in favor of Jasper Construction Ltd, dismissing David's claim and ordering him to pay the defendant's costs.
David’s legal team believes HHJ Miller made a significant error regarding the "duty of care" owed by subcontractors. David decides to seek permission to appeal this final decision.
Based on the scenario above, what is the correct destination for David's appeal?
A. A District Judge in the County Court. B. A different Circuit Judge in the County Court. C. The High Court. D. The Court of Appeal (Civil Division). E. The Supreme Court.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Under the Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals) Order 2016, the general rule is that an appeal "flows upward" to the next level of seniority in the judicial hierarchy. Since the original decision was made by a Circuit Judge in the County Court, the appeal is heard by a High Court Judge.
Option A and B are incorrect. You cannot appeal "downward" to a District Judge or "sideways" to another judge of the same rank.
Option D is incorrect. Historically, final decisions in the Multi-Track went straight to the Court of Appeal. However, the 2016 Order changed this to lighten the Court of Appeal's workload. Now, almost all first appeals from a Circuit Judge, whether interim or final, go to the High Court.
Option E is incorrect. The Supreme Court is the court of final resort and typically only hears cases that have already been through the Court of Appeal.
Question 67 (BUSINESS LAW)
A firm established a variable security interest over its entire property in favor of a vendor, to secure ongoing payments.
Four years on, the firm secured a loan from a lender by issuing a debenture that included a variable security over all firm assets.
The vendor's security was never filed with the registrar of companies. However, prior to finalizing the debenture, the firm informed the lender about the vendor's existing valid security. The debenture was properly signed and promptly filed with the registrar. The firm entered insolvency proceedings eight months later, owing debts to both the vendor and the lender.
Which party holds priority over the firm's property? 
A.The lender, as the vendor's non-filing renders the security invalid against the firm. B. The vendor, since the lender was aware of the vendor's security through direct notification.
B. The lender, as the vendor's non-filing makes the security invalid against the insolvency officer and the lender.
C.  The vendor, because the lender's security arose within a year of the insolvency. E. The vendor, as priority for such securities is based purely on creation order.
The correct answer is C. 
Explanation 
Option C is correct. Under the Companies Act 2006, s.859H, a charge is void against an administrator or liquidator (and creditors like the lender) if not registered within 21 days of creation, regardless of actual notice. The vendor's failure to register invalidates it against the insolvency process and the lender. This is supported by case law, such as Re Monolithic Building Co [1915] 1 Ch 643, where the court confirmed that non-registration voids a charge against subsequent secured creditors and insolvency officials, even with notice. 
Option A is incorrect. Non-registration voids it against administrators and creditors, not the company itself pre-insolvency.
 Option B is incorrect. Actual notice does not cure non-registration for priority in insolvency. 
Option D is incorrect. The one-year rule applies to preferences under Insolvency Act 1986, s.239, but here the issue is registration, not preference. 
Option E is incorrect. While creation date generally determines priority between registered floating charges, non-registration overrides this.

Question 68 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
 A business is suing an auditing firm for careless advice leading to financial harm. The court has mandated full document exchange.
A three-page memo from an external consultant to the business's CEO is listed in the business's disclosure. The consultant is unaffiliated with either side. The memo was discovered in the CEO's files, and the sole version is held by the business's lawyer. It was evidently created solely to advise on preparing the initial demand letter for this lawsuit.
What grounds allow the business to deny access to the memo? 
A.The memo is outside the disclosing party's possession. 
B. The memo falls under solicitor-client confidentiality. 
C.Allowing access would be excessive relative to the dispute's scale. 
D.The memo is protected by anticipated litigation immunity. 
E. The memo postdates the incident giving rise to the claim.
The correct answer is D. 
Explanation Option D is correct. Litigation privilege protects documents created predominantly for the purpose of pending or contemplated litigation, including advice on claim preparation, even from third parties. The memo's sole purpose was advising on the letter before claim, qualifying it for this privilege under CPR 31. This is supported by case law, such as Three Rivers DC v Bank of England (No 6) [2004] UKHL 48, where the House of Lords clarified that litigation privilege applies to communications for obtaining advice or evidence in anticipated proceedings. 
Option A is incorrect. The memo is in the solicitor's control, which counts as the party's control for disclosure. 
Option B is incorrect. Legal advice privilege requires advice from a lawyer, not an independent consultant. 
Option C is incorrect. Proportionality might limit disclosure scope but does not apply here as privilege is absolute. 
Option E is incorrect. Privilege can apply to post-accrual documents if created for litigation purposes.
Question 69 (BUSINESS LAW)
A fitness enthusiast recently formed a company for an e-commerce fitness gear store. She is the only board member. The fitness enthusiast and her colleague, Elizabeth, hold all shares.
Before the company was officially registered, the enthusiast arranged a deal with a sportswear supplier. The agreement was executed, before the registration certificate arrived, by the enthusiast personally, acting for the future company.
Who, if at all, benefits from this agreement? 
A.Solely the company. 
B.Solely the shareholders. 
C. Solely the enthusiast. 
D.The enthusiast and company together. 
E.Nobody, as the deal is unenforceable.
The correct answer is C.
 Explanation 
Option C is correct. Under Companies Act 2006, s.51, a pre-incorporation contract made on behalf of a company is treated as made with the person purporting to act for it, who becomes personally liable and entitled unless the contract states otherwise. The company cannot ratify or benefit post-incorporation without novation. This is supported by case law, such as Phonogram Ltd v Lane [1982] QB 938, where the Court of Appeal held that promoters are personally bound by pre-incorporation contracts, and the company gains no automatic rights. 
Option A is incorrect. The company was not yet formed, so it cannot be a party without further agreement. 
Option B is incorrect. Shareholders have no direct benefit; liability falls on the promoter. 
Option D is incorrect. The company does not automatically share benefits; it requires separate adoption.
 Option E is incorrect. The contract is valid but binds the enthusiast personally.
Question 70 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
 A resident in England claims her privacy rights under Article 8 of the ECHR were violated by a government body. She wants to challenge it but avoids legal action under the Human Rights Act 1998 due to potential exposure and expenses. Her affluent sibling, unaffected by the issue, offers to sue in her place.
May the sibling initiate proceedings as the resident's proxy under the HRA? 
A.Yes, as relatives are expressly allowed locus standi under the HRA. 
B. Yes, since the HRA permits proxies when the affected person fears publicity
C. No, only those directly impacted can sue, and the sibling is not impacted. 
D.Yes, the court will approve if the sibling can cover litigation costs. 
E.No, proxies under the HRA are limited to class actions with duplicate claims.
The correct answer is option C. 
Explanation
 Option C is correct. Section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires that only a "victim" of the unlawful act can bring proceedings, mirroring ECHR standing rules. Representatives cannot sue unless the victim is unable (e.g., deceased or incapacitated), and unaffected family members lack standing. This is supported by case law, such as Rabone v Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust [2012] UKSC 2, where the Supreme Court emphasized that HRA claims are restricted to actual victims, not proxies without direct impact.
 Option A is incorrect. The HRA does not grant automatic standing to family without victim status. 
Option B is incorrect. Anonymity concerns do not allow proxy claims; the victim must sue personally. 
Option D is incorrect. Financial ability does not confer standing; victimhood is required.
 Option E is incorrect. The HRA does not provide for representative actions in this context.
Question 71 (LEGAL SYSTEM)
A researcher discovers an article in a national journal discussing upcoming regulations mandating enhanced safety features for electric scooters used in urban areas. Intrigued, she accesses the full text of the legislation online and notes the following details:
“Electric Scooters Safety Act 2023 CHAPTER 18 An Act to establish provisions for the safe operation and maintenance of electric scooters in public spaces. [12th June 2023]”
The researcher is puzzled about the importance of the date 12th June 2023 mentioned in the Act. She contacts her organization's legal advisor to seek clarification on this specific date's role in the legislative process.
What guidance should the legal advisor provide regarding the date?
A.It marks the occasion when the latest version of the bill was introduced to the lower house of Parliament.
B. It represents the tentative effective date for the law's implementation. 
C.It indicates the day the legislation obtained formal approval from the monarch.
D. It signifies the official start date when the law becomes enforceable.
E.  It denotes the point at which the bill completed its review phase in the upper house of Parliament.
The correct answer is option C. 
Explanation 
Option C is correct. In UK statutory instruments, the date listed immediately after the Act's description typically signifies the date of Royal Assent, which is the final stage where the monarch formally approves the bill, transforming it into law. This date does not indicate commencement, which may be specified separately within the Act or by subsequent orders. This principle is supported by the legislative process outlined in the Royal Assent Act 1967, which modernized the procedure, and confirmed in cases such as R (Jackson) v Attorney General [2005] UKHL 56, where the House of Lords discussed the significance of Royal Assent in validating parliamentary enactments. 
Option A is incorrect. The introduction to the House of Commons occurs earlier in the bill's journey, not at this final notation. 
Option B is incorrect. Provisional or commencement dates are explicitly stated within the Act's provisions, not as the bracketed date. 
Option D is incorrect. Commencement dates are often set by the Act itself or ministerial orders, separate from the assent date. 
Option E is incorrect. Committee stages happen mid-process in either house, not tied to this end-date notation.
Question 71 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
A junior legal assistant joins a law practice that operates as an authorized alternative business structure, specializing in family law matters. This is her first role in the legal sector, with no prior experience in similar environments. She is assigned to the matrimonial division, where her tasks involve preparing documents and client correspondence, all under the close oversight of a qualified family law solicitor.
Is the junior legal assistant governed by oversight from a recognized legal oversight body?
A.Yes, under the jurisdiction of the body regulating solicitors. 
B. Yes, under the authority of the overarching legal services oversight entity.
C.  Yes, under the professional association for legal practitioners.
D. No, given her position as a junior assistant exempts her from such oversight.
E.No, due to her work being closely monitored by a licensed solicitor.
The correct answer is option A. 
Explanation 
Option A is correct. Employees in SRA-authorized firms, including non-qualified staff like paralegals, are subject to the SRA's regulatory framework to ensure ethical standards and public protection. This extends to all individuals working in such entities, regardless of qualification level. This is supported by the SRA Standards and Regulations 2019, particularly the SRA Code of Conduct for Individuals, and affirmed in cases like SRA v Chan [2015] EWHC 2659 (Admin), where the High Court upheld the SRA's authority over non-solicitor employees in regulated firms for misconduct.
 Option B is incorrect. The Legal Services Board oversees regulators but does not directly regulate individuals. 
Option C is incorrect. The Law Society represents solicitors but does not regulate; that's the SRA's role. 
Option D is incorrect. Position alone does not exempt; regulation applies to maintain firm-wide standards. 
Option E is incorrect. Supervision mitigates risk but does not remove regulatory obligations.

Question 72 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Mr. Ali was served with a Particulars of Claim for a debt of £10,000 on 1st March. Believing he had 14 days to respond, he filed an Acknowledgment of Service on 10th March. Unbeknownst to him, because he had been served with the claim form earlier, the deadline for filing a Defence was actually 28 days from service of the Particulars, which fell on 29th March. He filed his Defence on 25th March. However, the claimant's automated system flagged the case as undefended after 14 days from the Acknowledgment of Service and automatically requested judgment in default on 15th March. The court entered default judgment on 18th March. Mr. Ali's solicitor discovers this judgment on 30th March and immediately applies to set it aside.
On which of the following grounds is the court mandatorily required to set aside the default judgment under CPR Part 13?
A. Because the Defence has a real prospect of success.
B. Because the judgment was entered at a time when Mr. Ali had already filed an Acknowledgment of Service.
C. Because the judgment was wrongly entered
D. Because Mr. Ali has a reasonable excuse for his misunderstanding of the time limits.
E. Because the claimant should have given Mr. Ali a warning before requesting judgment.
The correct option is C.
Explanation:
Option C is correct. CPR 13.2 sets out the mandatory grounds for setting aside a default judgment. One such ground is where "the judgment was wrongly entered because... the defendant had already filed... a defence [before judgment was entered]." Here, the Defence was due on 29th March, and was filed on 25th March, which was before the deadline. The judgment was entered on 18th March, before the Defence was filed, but crucially, also before the deadline for filing a Defence had even passed. Therefore, the defendant was not yet in default at the time judgment was entered, making the judgment "wrongly entered." The court has no discretion and must set it aside.
Option A is incorrect. This is a factor for discretionary set aside under CPR 13.3(1)(a), not a mandatory ground.
Option B is incorrect. Filing an Acknowledgment of Service does not, in itself, prevent a default judgment from being entered if a Defence is not filed in time. The mandatory ground depends on whether the time for filing the Defence had expired.
Option D is incorrect. The reason for the default is irrelevant to the mandatory ground; the test is purely procedural.
Option E is incorrect. There is no general procedural requirement for a warning.
Question 73 (LEGAL SERVICES)
A legal practitioner at a firm is handling a transaction for a client acquiring a newly constructed commercial warehouse valued at £500,000. The exchange of contracts occurred several months prior, construction is complete, and the final closing is scheduled for the upcoming week. Two months ago, the firm's compliance officer properly filed an online suspicious transaction report with the relevant agency after the practitioner uncovered details suggesting the client's involvement in financial impropriety. The report sought approval to continue with the warehouse acquisition.
A denial of permission was issued six weeks ago. Since then, there has been no additional correspondence from the agency, no judicial proceedings initiated by them, no measures taken against the client or their holdings, and the client remains unaware of any ongoing probe into their finances.
Would the compliance officer violate provisions of the anti-money laundering legislation by authorizing the practitioner to finalize the acquisition next week? 
A.Yes, since a denial of permission has been issued. 
B. Yes, as the denial has not been overturned within the subsequent 31-day window.
C.No, given that over 31 days have elapsed since the report's submission. 
D.No, since the client is uninformed of the investigation and no actions have targeted the client or their assets. 
E. No, as more than 31 days have passed since the denial was communicated.
The correct answer is option E. 
Explanation 
Option E is correct. Under Section 335 of POCA 2002, if a disclosure is made and consent is refused, the person is treated as having appropriate consent if the moratorium period of 31 days expires without the authorities taking further legal action to restrain the assets. Because six weeks have passed since the denial, the moratorium has ended, and the compliance officer can validly authorize the transaction.In National Crime Agency v N [2017] EWCA Civ 253, the Court of Appeal clarified the moratorium's duration and consequences of expiry.
·  Option A and B are incorrect: A denial is not permanent. It only triggers the 31-day window. Once that window shuts without further legal intervention or a court-ordered extension, the "denial" effectively expires, and the firm is protected from prosecution for the principal money laundering offenses.
·    Option C is incorrect: The 31-day clock starts from the date of the refusal/denial, not the date of the report's submission. While more than 31 days have passed since submission, the legal trigger for the defense in this specific scenario is the time elapsed since the denial.
·   Option D is incorrect: While "tipping off" (S.333A POCA) is a separate crime, the fact that the client is uninformed does not grant the solicitor a defense to the principal money laundering offense (S.328). The defense comes purely from the expiry of the statutory timelines.
Question 74 (TORT)
 A gentleman receives a state-of-the-art smartwatch as a surprise anniversary gift from his spouse. The spouse acquired it from a reputable electronics outlet, unaware that it was intended as a present for the gentleman. Upon attempting to use the smartwatch, the gentleman discovers it fails to activate due to a manufacturing defect in the charging mechanism. Reluctant to disappoint his spouse by revealing the issue, he takes the smartwatch to a nearby authorized service center.
The center rectifies the defect for a fee of £200, which the gentleman settles. He now seeks to pursue a negligence claim against the outlet to recoup the £200 repair expense.
Is the gentleman able to reclaim the £200 in repair expenses through a negligence action against the outlet? 
A. No, since the flaw in the smartwatch constitutes an unpredictable detriment.
B. Yes, given that the smartwatch was defective. 
C. Yes, as the repair expenses represent ensuing financial detriment. 
D. No, as the repair expenses constitute unadulterated financial detriment. 
E. Yes, since the outlet bears absolute responsibility for the repair expenses.
The correct answer is option D. 
Explanation 
Option D is correct. The £200 repair fee is a purely financial loss resulting from the acquisition of a defective item. Because the defect did not cause personal injury or damage to other property, it is classified as "pure economic loss" (unadulterated financial detriment), which is not recoverable in a negligence action .
In Murphy v Brentwood District Council [1991], the House of Lords ruled that the cost of repairing a defective building (to prevent it from causing future damage) was pure economic loss and therefore irrecoverable in negligence. The same principle applies to consumer goods like smartwatches.
Option A is incorrect; while the defect might have been "unpredictable," that is not the legal reason for the claim failing. Even if the defect were entirely predictable, the "pure economic loss" rule would still block the claim.
Option B is incorrect; merely showing a product is defective is sufficient for a contract claim (by the buyer), but it is not sufficient for a negligence claim (by a third party) if no physical damage occurred.
Option C is incorrect; "ensuing financial detriment" (consequential loss) is only recoverable if it follows a physical injury or damage to other property. Since the watch only damaged itself, the loss is "pure," not "consequential."
Option E is incorrect; there is no principle of "absolute responsibility" in negligence for repair costs of a defective product. Liability in negligence requires a duty of care to avoid a specific type of harm, and the law generally does not impose a duty to avoid causing pure economic loss.
Question 75 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Sarah is being sued by a former client for professional negligence. Sarah believes that if she is found liable, her former business partner, James, is contractually bound to indemnify her for 50% of any damages. James is not currently a party to the proceedings. Sarah has just received the Particulars of Claim and is preparing her Defence.
Which of the following describes the correct procedure for Sarah to bring James into the proceedings?
A.Sarah must wait until the main trial is over and then issue a separate Part 7 claim against James.
B. Sarah can issue a Part 20 claim against James without the court’s permission, provided she files it at the same time as her Defence. 
C.Sarah must apply for the court’s permission to add James as a "Third Party" because he is not an original party to the claim. 
D.Sarah should include her claim against James within the body of her Defence document under the heading "Counterclaim." 
E.Sarah must serve a "Notice of Contribution" on James within 14 days of receiving the claim.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under CPR 20.7, a defendant may make an additional claim (a Part 20 claim) against a person who is not already a party without the court's permission if the additional claim is issued before or at the same time as the defendant files their Defence. 
Option A is incorrect. While possible, it is inefficient; the purpose of Part 20 is to deal with all related issues in one set of proceedings. 
Option C is incorrect. Permission is only required if the Defence has already been filed (CPR 20.7(3)(b)).
 Option D is incorrect. A claim against a non-party is an "Additional Claim" (Third Party claim), not a "Counterclaim." A counterclaim is specifically against the claimant (or the claimant and someone else). 
Option E is incorrect. A "Notice" (CPR 20.6) is used for contribution/indemnity claims against people who are already parties to the action.

Question 76 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
In a commercial dispute, Company A sues Company B for breach of a distribution agreement. Company B files a Defence and Counterclaim against Company A. Concurrently, Company B issues a Part 20 claim against Company C (its former director), alleging that if Company B is liable to Company A, it is due to Company C's personal guarantees and warranties of performance. Company C is served with the Part 20 Claim Form and Particulars. Company C wishes to defend this claim.
What must Company C do to defend the Part 20 claim, and how does this relate to the main proceedings?
A. File and serve an Acknowledgement of Service and then a Defence to the Part 20 claim
B.File and serve a Defence to the original Claim Form issued by Company A.
C.C. Apply to the court to strike out the Part 20 claim on the basis that it is vexatious, as no defence is required until that application is heard.
D. Do nothing in response to the Part 20 claim, as liability is only contingent; they only need to participate if Company B first loses the main case.
E. File and serve a Defence to Company B's Counterclaim, as the Part 20 claim is an adjunct to it.
The correct option is A.
Explanation:
Option A is correct. A Part 20 defendant (Company C) is a party to the proceedings for the purposes of the Part 20 claim against them. Their procedural obligations are similar to a main defendant: they must file an Acknowledgement of Service (CPR 20.4(1)) and then a Defence to the Part 20 claim (CPR 20.4(2)). They are not automatically a party to the main claim between A and B unless the court orders otherwise.

Option B is incorrect. The Part 20 claim is a separate, albeit connected, cause of action. Company C does not become a defendant to the original claim brought by A unless formally joined.
Option C is incorrect. While an application to strike out is possible, it does not remove the obligation to file a Defence within the stipulated timeframe unless the court specifically orders a stay. Failing to file a Defence could lead to default judgment.
Option D is incorrect. This is a common and serious misconception. The contingent nature of the liability ("if we are liable...") does not suspend procedural obligations. Company C must actively defend the Part 20 claim on its merits.
Option E is incorrect. The Part 20 claim is a distinct claim issued under Part 20. It is not part of or a subset of the Counterclaim, even if the facts are related. It requires its own Defence.

Question 77 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
 Mark is suing a local catering company, Grace's Kitchen Ltd, for food poisoning. At the trial, Mark wishes to rely on a witness statement from his brother, Luke. Luke’s statement says: "I wasn't at the dinner, but our sister, Mary, called me that night and told me the chicken Mark was eating looked undercooked and smelled strange." Mary is currently traveling abroad and is unavailable to give evidence herself.
Which of the following best describes the admissibility of Luke’s statement regarding what Mary said?
A.The statement is inadmissible because it is "double hearsay" and prohibited in civil proceedings. 
B. The statement is admissible as of right, and the court must treat Mary’s comments as proven fact.
C.  The statement is admissible, but Mark should serve a hearsay notice on Grace's Kitchen Ltd. 
D.The statement is inadmissible because Mary is not deceased or too ill to attend court. 
E. The statement is admissible only if Mark can prove that Luke has a better memory than Mary.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Under the Civil Evidence Act 1995, hearsay (including "double hearsay") is generally admissible in civil proceedings. However, under CPR 33, a party intending to rely on hearsay must give notice to the other side. 
Option A is incorrect. Civil law, unlike criminal law, does not have a general ban on hearsay or multiple hearsay. 
Option B is incorrect. While admissible, the court will evaluate the weight of the evidence under s.4 of the Act. It is rarely treated as "proven fact" if contested. Option D is incorrect. The unavailability of the witness (traveling abroad) goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.
 Option E is incorrect. This is not a legal test for hearsay.

Question 78 (CONTRACR)
Mary,  a young athlete, aged 16, signs a multi-year agreement with a sports manager to handle endorsement deals related to her career in professional tennis. Her guardians do not co-endorse the agreement. Shortly after, still 16, the athlete reconsiders and wishes to dissolve the agreement with the manager. The sports manager dispute this stating that they have a binding contract.
Is the athlete permitted to dissolve the agreement? 
A.No, as she possesses complete legal capacity at over 15 years old. 
B. No, given it's a business-oriented agreement rather than a personal one. 
C.No, as a youth, it qualifies as an essential agreement. 
D.Yes, as a youth, it does not qualify as an essential agreement. E. Yes, since her guardians did not co-endorse the agreement.
The correct answer is option D. 
Explanation 
Option D is correct. Minors' contracts are generally voidable unless for necessaries (essentials like food, clothing, or education beneficial to the minor). An agency for endorsements is not a necessary, allowing repudiation. This is supported by common law principles in the Minors' Contracts Act 1987, and case law such as Nash v Inman [1908] 2 KB 1, where the Court of Appeal defined necessaries as items suitable to the minor's condition and actual requirements, excluding non-essentials like luxury or commercial services. 
Option A is incorrect. Full capacity begins at 18; minors have limited capacity. Option B is incorrect. The commercial nature does not bind if not a necessary. 
Option C is incorrect. It does not meet necessaries criteria for minors. 
Option E is incorrect. Guardian involvement is irrelevant for voidability.
Question 79 (TORTS)
James and Robert successfully burgled a high-end electronics store. While fleeing the scene in a getaway car driven by Robert, James was sitting in the back seat with the stolen goods. Robert drove at excessive speeds to evade a police patrol and crashed into a wall. James suffered a spinal injury and brought a claim in negligence against Robert for his reckless driving.
How is the court most likely to respond to James’s claim?
A.The court will allow the claim but reduce damages by 50% for contributory negligence. 
B. The court will dismiss the claim entirely under the doctrine of illegality. 
C. The claim will succeed because Robert owed a duty of care to his passenger regardless of their activity. 
D.The claim will succeed only if James can prove he was forced into the burglary under duress. 
E.The court will allow the claim but order that any damages be paid directly to the electronics store as compensation.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Following the Supreme Court decision in Patel v Mirza, the court applies a trio of considerations: (i) the underlying purpose of the prohibition violated, (ii) any other relevant public policies, and (iii) proportionality. In cases like Pitts v Hunt, where the claimant and defendant are engaged in a joint illegal enterprise (the "getaway"), the claim is generally barred because it would be inconsistent with the law to award damages arising from serious criminal conduct. Therefore, options A, C, D and E are incorrect.
Question 80 (LEGAL SERVICES)
A woman is apprehended and held at a law enforcement facility suspected of minor theft, classified as a non-indictable offense. She lacks stable housing and any source of earnings.
During her questioning session, she proceeds without legal counsel and refutes the allegations. Post-session, she learns of impending charges and expresses a desire for legal guidance to avert the charging process.
Does the woman qualify for state-sponsored legal counsel at the facility? 
A.No, since the alleged offense is non-indictable. 
B. Yes, due to her absence of a permanent residence within the jurisdiction. 
C. Yes, as she is under arrest and detained at the facility. 
D.Yes, as she meets the financial eligibility criteria. 
E. No, given that the questioning session has concluded.
The correct answer is option C. 
Explanation Option C is correct.
 Individuals arrested and held at a police station are entitled to free legal advice irrespective of offense type or financial status, to safeguard rights during custody. This is supported by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, s 58, and case law such as R v Samuel [1988] QB 615, where the Court of Appeal emphasized the absolute right to legal advice in custody to prevent miscarriages of justice. 
Option A is incorrect. Entitlement applies to all offenses while in custody.
 Option B is incorrect. Residency is irrelevant; custody triggers the right. 
Option D is incorrect. No means test for station advice; it's automatic. 
Option E is incorrect. Advice is available post-interview if still in custody.
Question 81 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
A ruling has been issued by the Appellate Tribunal (Civil Branch) supporting the plaintiff in a complex commercial dispute involving intellectual property rights. The respondent now seeks authorization to challenge this ruling through further appeal, citing potential errors in legal interpretation and factual assessment.
The case originated in a lower tribunal where initial evidence was presented, and the Appellate Tribunal's decision was based on a thorough review of precedents and statutory provisions. The respondent believes the matter raises significant points of law that warrant higher judicial scrutiny.
Which judicial bodies possess the authority to approve such an appeal? 
A.Solely the Appellate Tribunal. 
B. Solely the Apex Court. 
C. Solely the Upper Chamber. 
D.Both the Appellate Tribunal and the Apex Court. 
E. Both the Appellate Tribunal and the Upper Chamber.
The correct answer is option D.
 Explanation
 Option D is correct. Under the legal framework governing appeals in England and Wales, permission to appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) can be granted either by the Court of Appeal itself or by the Supreme Court. This dual authority ensures that appeals are filtered appropriately, with the lower appellate court having the first opportunity to assess merit, and the highest court stepping in if necessary. This is supported by the Access to Justice Act 1999 and the Supreme Court Act 1981 (now largely superseded by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005), as well as Practice Direction 52C of the Civil Procedure Rules. In the landmark case of R (Cart) v Upper Tribunal [2011] UKSC 28, the Supreme Court affirmed the structured appeal permissions, emphasizing that while the Court of Appeal can grant leave, the Supreme Court retains ultimate discretion for cases of general public importance, preventing abuse of the appellate process and maintaining judicial efficiency. 
Option A is incorrect. The Appellate Tribunal alone cannot be the only body; the higher court provides an additional layer. 
Option B is incorrect. The Apex Court is not the sole granter; initial permission often comes from the lower appellate level. 
Option C is incorrect. The Upper Chamber (House of Lords) is outdated; it was replaced by the Supreme Court in 2009.
 Option E is incorrect. Combining Appellate Tribunal with the defunct Upper Chamber ignores current judicial structure.
Question 82 (BUSINESS LAW)
Fatima is a UK resident. In the 2024/25 tax year, she has the following income:
1. Employment income (from her full-time job in England): £48,000. Her employer deducted £7,200 in income tax under PAYE.
2.Trading income (from a weekend sole trader business): £15,000.
3. Savings income (from a building society account): £1,200 (gross).
She has no other income and makes no Gift Aid donations or pension contributions. Assume the standard Personal Allowance is £12,570, the Basic Rate band is £37,700, the Personal Savings Allowance for a higher rate taxpayer is £500, and savings income is taxed at 0% within the PSA and at 40% above it.
What is Fatima's total income tax liability for 2024/25?
A. Liability £13,920
B. Liability £12,912. 
C. Liability £12,860
D. Liability £15,500
E. Liability £7,200

The correct option is B.
Calculation:

Total Income: £48,000 + £15,000 + £1,200 = £64,200.

Less Personal Allowance: £64,200 - £12,570 = £51,630 Taxable Income.

Tax Allocation:

Non-Savings Income (Employment & Trading): £51,630 - £1,200 (savings) = £50,430.

First £37,700 @ 20% = £7,540.

Remaining £12,730 (£50,430 - £37,700) @ 40% = £5,092.

Savings Income: £1,200.

PSA for higher rate taxpayer is £500 @ 0% = £0.

Remaining £700 (£1,200 - £500) falls in higher rate band @ 40% = £280.

Total Tax Liability: £7,540 + £5,092 + £280 = £12,912. 
Question 83 (BUSINESS LAW)
 For the year ended 31 March 2025, "Precision Engineering Ltd" has the following figures: Trading profits (per accounts) of £550,000; bank interest received of £10,000; a chargeable gain on the sale of a factory of £120,000; and capital allowances claimed of £85,000. The company made a qualifying charitable donation of £25,000. Assume the main rate of Corporation Tax is 25%.
What is the company's total Corporation Tax liability for the financial year 2024 (applicable to profits over £250,000)?
A. £190,000
B. £178,750
C. £163,750
D. £142,500
E. £138,750
The correct option is D.
Explanation:
Option D is correct. The calculation is as follows:
Taxable Total Profits: Start with Trading Profits (£550,000). Deduct Capital Allowances (£85,000) = £465,000. Add Bank Interest (loan relationship profit) (£10,000) = £475,000. Add Chargeable Gain (£120,000) = £595,000. Deduct the qualifying charitable donation (£25,000) = £570,000 Taxable Total Profits.
Tax Liability: £570,000 * 25% (main rate for profits > £250k) = £142,500.
Option A incorrectly uses the trading profit before any deductions: £680,000 * 25% = £170,000 (and also miscalculates the sum).
Option B likely fails to deduct the charitable donation: £595,000 * 25% = £148,750.
Option C likely fails to add the chargeable gain: £475,000 * 25% = £118,750.
Option E likely uses the wrong rate or omits the gain and donation.


Question 84 (BUSINESS LAW)
TechGrowth Ltd is a rapidly expanding software development company based in Reading. Historically, the company has been classified as "small" for tax purposes, comfortably paying its Corporation Tax in a single lump sum nine months after its year-end.
However, for the accounting period starting 1 January 2025 and ending 31 December 2025, the company’s taxable profits have surged to £2.4 million due to a major government contract. The company has no associated companies.
By which dates must TechGrowth Ltd pay its Corporation Tax liability for the 2025 accounting period?
A.In a single lump sum
B. In two equal installments
C. In four quarterly installments
D.Within 30 days of Marcus filing the CT600 tax return in the summer of 2026.
E. In monthly installments starting from the first month of the accounting period.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Large companies (those with profits between £1.5 million and £20 million) must pay their tax in four quarterly installments. For a standard 12-month accounting period, these installments are due:
6 months and 13 days after the start of the period (14 July).
3 months after the first installment (14 October).
3 months after the second installment (14 January).
3 months after the third installment (14 April).
Option A is incorrect. This 9-month-and-1-day rule applies only to small and medium companies (those with profits under £1.5 million).
Option B is incorrect. This describes the "Payment on Account" system used by individuals in Self-Assessment, not the corporate regime.
Option D is incorrect. The deadline for payment is independent of when the return (CT600) is actually filed.
Option E is incorrect. Only "very large" companies (profits exceeding £20 million) face even further acceleration, though their payments are still quarterly, just earlier in the cycle.
Question 85 (LEGAL SERVICES)
James, a solicitor at a general high-street practice, is advising a long-standing client, Mrs. Evans, on her will. During the meeting, Mrs. Evans expresses concern about the poor performance of her investment portfolio, which is managed by a large bank. She shows James the latest statements. James, who has a personal interest in the stock market, reviews them and says, "I think you're far too heavily weighted in bonds given your age. If I were you, I'd sell half of these corporate bonds and move the money into a diversified equity fund like the 'Global Growth Index Trust' to get better returns over the long term." Mrs. Evans thanks him for the clear advice.
Which of the following best describes the regulatory position regarding James's advice?
A. It is unregulated, friendly advice from a solicitor to a client and falls outside the financial services regime.
B. It constitutes the regulated activity of advising on investments, a serious breach has likely occurred.
C. It is permissible because it was given in the context of will preparation, which is a core legal activity.
D. It is allowed under the  professional firm exemption in Part XX of FSMA,
E. It is the regulated activity of "managing investments," but James can rely on the "overseas persons" exemption.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. Under Article 53 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (RAO), "advising on investments" is a specified activity when it relates to a "specified investment" (such as units in a collective investment scheme like the 'Global Growth Index Trust'). James gave a specific, tailored recommendation to buy a particular fund. This is regulated advice. A firm must be authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to carry on this activity, unless an exemption applies. A solicitor's firm is not automatically authorised.
Option A is incorrect. The advice was specific, given "by way of business" in a professional context, and relates to a specified investment, bringing it within the regulatory perimeter.
Option C is incorrect. The context does not automatically make it permissible. The nature of the advice itself determines if it is regulated.
Option D is incorrect. The Part XX exemption (also known as the "professional business exemption") allows an exempt professional firm to carry on certain regulated activities incidental to its professional services without full FCA authorisation. However, the activity must be incidental. Here, giving specific investment product advice is unlikely to be viewed as merely incidental to will drafting; it is substantive investment advice.
Option E is incorrect. The activity is advising, not managing. The "overseas persons" exemption is irrelevant.
Question 86 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Chloe is a professional cyclist who was seriously injured when a car negligently driven by Mr. Evans collided with her during a training ride. She has issued a substantial personal injury claim. Liability is strongly contested by Mr. Evans's insurers. However, Chloe's medical evidence is clear that her injuries are severe and will prevent her from competing for at least two years, causing a significant loss of earnings. She is struggling financially and applies for an interim payment under CPR Part 25.7.
What is the threshold condition Chloe must satisfy for the court to consider making an interim payment order?
A. She must prove on the balance of probabilities that she will win the case on liability.
B. She must show that the defendant has admitted liability.
C. She must satisfy the court that, if the claim went to trial, she would obtain judgment for a substantial sum of money.
D. She must demonstrate that the defendant is insured and has the means to pay.
E. She must show that her financial hardship is due solely to the accident.
Correct Option: C
Explanation: Option C is correct. Under CPR 25.7(1), the court may make an interim payment order only if one of several conditions is met. The most common in contested cases is condition (c): "that the claimant has obtained judgment against the respondent for damages to be assessed or for a sum of money (other than costs) to be assessed." Alternatively, condition (e) applies here: "that, if the claim went to trial, the claimant would obtain judgment for a substantial amount of money against the defendant from whom he is seeking an interim payment..." The court must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the claimant will succeed (British and Commonwealth Holdings plc v Quadrex Holdings Inc [1989] QB 842). The strength of the medical evidence on loss supports this.
Option A sets too high a standard; the test is one of reasonable confidence, not proof on the balance at an interim stage.
Option B is incorrect; an admission of liability is one condition (CPR 25.7(1)(a)), but it is not the only route.
Option D is irrelevant to the threshold condition; it relates to the practicality of payment, not the entitlement.
Option E is incorrect; while hardship may be a reason to seek an interim payment, it is not a legal precondition for the order.
Question 87 (CONTRACT)
Before buying a second-hand luxury car from "FastLane Autos," Sebastian asked the sales manager specifically if the car had ever been involved in a major accident. The manager, knowing the car had been extensively repaired after a serious front-end collision, stated, "It has a completely clean history, no accidents." Relying on this, Sebastian bought the car for £40,000. He later discovered the truth from an independent engineer. Sebastian wishes to rescind the contract and claim damages.
Under which cause of action is Sebastian likely to recover the most advantageous remedy?
A. Innocent misrepresentation under s.2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967.
B. Negligent misstatement at common law.
C. Breach of a collateral warranty.
D. Fraudulent misrepresentation.
E. Negligent misrepresentation under s.2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967.
Correct Option: D
Explanation: Option D is correct. The manager's statement, made knowingly or recklessly without belief in its truth, constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation (deceit). The remedy for deceit is rescission (subject to bars) and damages. Crucially, damages for deceit are calculated on a tortious basis to restore the claimant to the position they would have been in had the tort not been committed, which can include all consequential losses without remoteness restrictions based on contemplation (Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd [1969] 2 QB 158). This is often more advantageous than under the Misrepresentation Act 1967. Rescission is also available as of right for fraud.
Option A is incorrect; damages under s.2(2) are discretionary and rescission may be barred if damages are awarded in lieu.
Option B is less advantageous than the statutory claim under s.2(1) MA 1967, which reverses the burden of proof.
Option C is possible but less clear-cut; the statement could be a collateral warranty, but the deliberate falsehood makes fraud a stronger and more comprehensive claim.
Option E is a strong claim under s.2(1) MA 1967 (which also permits rescission and damages), but the damages are assessed as if the representation were fraudulent (s.2(1)), yet the psychological and procedural advantages of a pure deceit claim can be significant.
Question 88 (TORTS)
A water utility company owns a remote, fenced-off service reservoir. Over time, a hole has developed in the perimeter fence. Local children, aware of the hole, often enter to play. The company is aware of both the hole and the children's trespass but has taken no steps to repair the fence, believing the deep, steep-sided reservoir itself is obvious and would deter entry. A 9-year-old child, Leo, climbs onto an unfixed, rusty metal cover over a water inlet. The cover gives way, and Leo falls into the water, suffering serious injury.
In a claim under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984, which of the following is the most significant factor in establishing that the company owed Leo a duty of care?
A. The company's failure to repair the fence constituted a breach of its duty under the 1957 Act.
B. The company was aware of the danger and that children were likely to trespass into the vicinity of that danger.
C. The injury occurred on the company's premises, creating strict liability.
D. The reservoir was an "allurement" to children.
E. Leo was a child, so the standard of care owed is automatically higher.
Correct Option: B
Explanation: 
The OLA 1984 governs an occupier’s liability toward trespassers (non-visitors). Unlike the 1957 Act, which applies to lawful visitors and imposes a broad "common duty of care," the 1984 Act only triggers a duty of care if three specific statutory conditions under Section 1(3) are met:
1.Awareness of the Danger: The occupier must be aware of the danger or have reasonable grounds to believe it exists (the rusty, unfixed metal cover).
2.Vicinity of the Danger: The occupier must know or have reasonable grounds to believe that the trespasser is in the vicinity of the danger or may come into it (the company knew children were entering through the hole in the fence).
3.Reasonable Protection: The risk is one against which, in all the circumstances, the occupier may reasonably be expected to offer some protection (a simple repair to the cover or the fence).
Option B directly addresses the second condition. Without the company's knowledge of the trespassers' presence near a known danger, no duty of care arises at all.
Option A is incorrect: The 1957 Act applies only to lawful visitors. Because Leo is a trespasser, his claim must be brought under the 1984 Act. A failure to repair a fence does not automatically create a duty toward a trespasser; it only helps establish the "vicinity" element of the 1984 Act.
Option C is incorrect: Occupiers' liability is never strict liability. The claimant must always prove that a duty was owed and that the occupier failed to take "reasonable care" in the circumstances.
Option D is incorrect: While "allurement" (something that attracts children, like a pool or berries) is a factor in determining if a duty exists, it is not a sufficient factor on its own under the 1984 Act. The statutory test in s.1(3) (knowledge of danger and presence) is the legal requirement for the duty to exist.
Option E is incorrect: While the standard of care (how much the occupier must do) may be higher for children because they are less careful than adults (s.2(3)(a) 1957 Act principles are often mirrored), the existence of the duty itself is not automatic just because the trespasser is a child. The s.1(3) conditions must still be satisfied first.
Question 89 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
A solicitor, Anya, acts for a client in a property transaction. The client instructs her to receive £100,000 from a third-party family member, to be held and used solely as the deposit for the purchase. The money is sent to Anya's firm's office bank account with a covering letter stating its purpose. Anya's firm is in serious financial difficulty. Before the deposit is due, the firm's cash flow crisis worsens.
What is Anya's obligation regarding this £100,000 under the SRA Accounts Rules?
A. She can, in an emergency, use the money for general office expenses provided she repays it before the deposit is due.
B. She must pay it immediately into a separate, designated client bank account.
C. She can retain it in the office account as it came from a third party, not the client.
D. She must return it to the third-party sender as she cannot act on instructions from a non-client.
E. She can pay it into a designated "Third-Party Managed Account" which is not a client account but is ring-fenced from office money.
Correct Option: B
Explanation: Option B is correct. Under Rule 2.1 of the SRA Accounts Rules 2019, "client money" is money held or received by you for a client or as trustee, and must be paid promptly into a client account. Rule 14.1 defines "client" to include, in relation to trust money, the trustee. Here, the solicitor is holding the money for the client (the purchaser) to use as a deposit, even though it originated from a third party. It is therefore client money and must be placed in a client account. The firm's financial difficulties are irrelevant; mixing this money with office money would be a serious breach.
Option A is a serious breach amounting to misappropriation of client funds, which is professional misconduct and potentially a criminal offence.
Option C is incorrect; the source of the funds does not determine their status. Money held for the purpose of a client's transaction is client money.
Option D is incorrect; the solicitor can receive money from a third party for a client's matter on the client's instructions. The duty is to the client to safeguard it.
Option E is incorrect; the SRA Accounts Rules require client money to be held in a client account, not a differently named account. A "Third-Party Managed Account" is not a recognized category under the rules for this purpose.
Question 90 (TORTS)
Elizabeth operates a boutique chemical laboratory on an industrial estate. She stores a large quantity of a specific solvent in a specialized tank. Due to an undetected structural failure in the tank (which occurred despite regular professional maintenance), the solvent leaked into the soil. It traveled underground for several hundred meters and eventually contaminated the private well of Peter, a neighboring organic farmer. Peter is now unable to use his well water for his crops.
Which of the following best describes Elizabeth’s liability under the rule in Rylands v Fletcher?
A.Elizabeth is not liable because the leak was caused by an undetected structural failure rather than her negligence.
B. Elizabeth is liable because the storage of industrial chemicals is a non-natural use of land.
C. Elizabeth is not liable because the solvent remained underground and therefore did not "escape" in the legal sense.
D. Elizabeth is only liable if Peter can prove that she failed to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the tank. 
E. Elizabeth is not liable because the rule in Rylands v Fletcher only applies to the escape of water.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under Rylands v Fletcher, liability is strict. It does not matter that Elizabeth was not negligent (Option A and D are incorrect). Industrial chemicals stored in large quantities on an industrial estate are considered a "non-natural use" (Cambridge Water v Eastern Counties Leather), and the solvent "escaped" from her control to Peter’s land. The liability is strict.
 Option C is incorrect. An escape occurs whenever the substance moves from the defendant’s land to a place outside their control; traveling underground still counts as an escape. 
Option E is incorrect. While the original case involved water, the rule has been applied to many things, including chemicals, gas, and even gypsies (Att-Gen v Corke)
