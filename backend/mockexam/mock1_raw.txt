Question 1 (Contract law)
Zephyr Ltd, a software developer, sends an email to TechSolutions Ltd on Monday offering to license its new data analytics platform for an annual fee of £50,000, stating the offer is open for acceptance until close of business on Friday. On Tuesday, TechSolutions’s procurement manager replies by email, “We accept your offer, but we require the inclusion of a service level agreement guaranteeing 99.9% uptime.” 
Zephyr’s sales director does not respond to this email. On Wednesday, TechSolutions sends a second email stating, “We hereby accept your original offer of Monday in its entirety.” Zephyr, having received a better offer from another company on Wednesday morning, wishes to withdraw. It emails TechSolutions at 3 p.m. on Wednesday stating the offer is withdrawn. TechSolutions’s second email was automatically received in Zephyr’s server at 2:55 p.m. on Wednesday, but due to IT filtering, it was not read by the sales director until 4 p.m.
Which of the following best describes whether a binding contract was formed?
A. Yes, a contract was formed at 2:55 p.m. on Wednesday when TechSolutions’s second email was received by Zephyr’s server, as this was an effective acceptance of the original offer.
B. No, a contract was never formed because TechSolutions’s Tuesday email constituted a counter-offer, which destroyed the original offer, and the Wednesday email was itself a new offer which Zephyr rejected by withdrawing.
C. No, a contract was not formed because acceptance is only effective when it comes to the attention of the offeror, which occurred after the withdrawal was communicated.
D. Yes, a contract was formed, but only on the terms of the counter-offer made on Tuesday, which Zephyr accepted by its silence and conduct in not objecting.
E. No, a contract requires a signed written agreement for a licence of this value, and mere email correspondence is insufficient under the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989.
The correct option is A.
Explanation
Option A is correct. The general rule is that acceptance by instantaneous communication (like email) takes effect when it is received (per Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corp). The Tuesday email was a counter-offer, which terminated the original offer. However, the Wednesday email was a fresh, valid acceptance of Zephyr’s original offer, which remained open. The acceptance was effective when received by Zephyr’s server at 2:55 p.m., which was before the withdrawal was communicated at 3 p.m. (following Brinkibon Ltd v Stahag Stahl). The fact it was not read until later is irrelevant.
Option B is incorrect. While the Tuesday email was a counter-offer that terminated the original offer, TechSolutions’s Wednesday email was not a new offer; it was a fresh acceptance. An offeree is free to accept an offer after having made a counter-offer, provided the original offer is still open, which it was until Friday.
Option C is incorrect. The rule that acceptance must be communicated does not require it to be read by the offeror, merely that it is received at the offeror’s address (Brinkibon). Reception by the server constitutes receipt. The withdrawal, communicated after receipt of the acceptance, was ineffective.
Option D is incorrect. Silence does not generally constitute acceptance (Felthouse v Bindley). Zephyr’s failure to respond to the counter-offer on Tuesday cannot be construed as acceptance, especially in a commercial context where a positive response would be expected.
Option E is incorrect. The Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989, s.2, which requires contracts for the sale or other disposition of an interest in land to be in signed writing, does not apply to a contract for the grant of a software licence, which is a chose in action, not an interest in land.
Question 2 (Business law)
Astra Ltd is a private company with four directors, one of whom is Priya. The company’s articles adopt the Model Articles (unamended). Priya owns 100% of the shares in a separate company, Vega Designs Ltd. The board of Astra Ltd, with Priya present but not voting, unanimously passes a resolution to enter into a contract to purchase a specialist patent from Vega Designs Ltd for £120,000. 
The market value of the patent, as per an independent valuation commissioned by the board, is £115,000. Astra Ltd’s most recent statutory accounts show net assets of £950,000. The transaction is of great strategic importance to Astra Ltd. The shareholders of Astra Ltd are the four directors and five external investors. No shareholder approval for the transaction has been sought.
Is the contract between Astra Ltd and Vega Designs Ltd valid and enforceable?
A. Yes, the contract is valid because it was approved by a quorate board meeting where the interested director did not vote, and the transaction is on arm’s length terms as the price is close to market value.
B. No, the contract is voidable by Astra Ltd because it is a substantial property transaction with a director-connected person which required, but did not receive, prior shareholder approval.
C. Yes, the contract is valid because the transaction is for the acquisition of an asset, not its transfer to a director, and therefore falls outside the scope of s.190 of the Companies Act 2006.
D. No, the contract is void ab initio because Priya breached her duty under s.177 of the Companies Act 2006 by failing to declare the nature and extent of her interest to the board before the transaction was entered into.
E. Yes, the contract is valid because the value of the transaction (£120,000) does not exceed 10% of Astra Ltd’s net asset value (£95,000) and is therefore not ‘substantial’ for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under s.190 of the Companies Act 2006, a ‘substantial property transaction’ between a company and a director (or a person connected to a director, such as a company they control) requires prior approval by the members (shareholders). The transaction value (£120k) exceeds the lesser of £100k or 10% of the company’s net asset value (10% of £950k = £95k). Therefore, it is ‘substantial’. Failure to obtain approval renders the transaction voidable by the company (s.195).
Option A is incorrect. While board approval and fair terms are relevant, they do not circumvent the statutory requirement for member approval under s.190 for a substantial property transaction with a director-connected party.
Option C is incorrect. Section 190 applies to both the acquisition from, and transfer to, a director (or connected person) of a ‘substantial’ non-cash asset. The purchase of the patent from Vega Designs Ltd (a company controlled by Priya) is clearly within the scope of the section.
Option D is incorrect. A breach of the duty to declare an interest under s.177 (which Priya likely complied with by being present) does not render the contract void, but may lead to other consequences. The primary defect here is the lack of shareholder approval under s.190, which makes the transaction voidable, not void.
Option E is incorrect. The test under s.191 is whether the value exceeds the lesser of £100,000 or 10% of the company’s net asset value (based on its most recent accounts). Here, 10% of £950,000 is £95,000. The transaction value of £120,000 exceeds both £100,000 and £95,000, so it is substantial.
Question 3 (Legal Services)
In a complex commercial fraud claim, the claimant company has given standard disclosure. Its list includes an email chain between the claimant’s in-house lawyer (a qualified solicitor) and its Finance Director. The emails discuss two things: 
(i)the legal implications of a newly discovered internal audit report that suggests misconduct, and 
(ii)practical business steps to mitigate potential financial fallout. The defendant seeks inspection of this email chain. The claimant objects, asserting privilege. The defendant argues that the ‘in-house lawyer’ was acting in a business/commercial capacity, not a legal advisory one, and that the emails concern business strategy, not legal advice.
On what basis is the claimant most likely to succeed in withholding inspection of the email chain?
A. The entire email chain is protected by litigation privilege, as it was created after litigation was reasonably in contemplation and for the dominant purpose of conducting that litigation.
B. The entire email chain is protected by legal advice privilege, as it constitutes a confidential communication between a client (the Finance Director) and its lawyer for the purpose of seeking and receiving legal advice.
C. The email chain is not privileged at all because an in-house lawyer’s communications are not covered by legal professional privilege where they involve commercial, non-legal matters.
D. The claimant may only redact and withhold those specific parts of the emails that seek or give legal advice; the remainder discussing commercial steps must be disclosed.
E. The email chain is protected from disclosure because it contains references to an internal audit report, which is itself a privileged document.
The correct option is D.
Explanation
Option D is correct. Legal advice privilege (applying to communications between lawyer and client for the purpose of giving/receiving legal advice) attaches to specific communications or parts of communications. Where a single document contains both privileged (legal advice) and non-privileged (commercial advice) material, the party may redact the privileged portions and must disclose the rest (ABC Ltd v Y). The court will examine the ‘dominant purpose’ of each part of the communication.
Option A is incorrect. Litigation privilege protects communications with third parties (or with the client) made for the dominant purpose of existing or contemplated litigation. While the audit might trigger litigation contemplation, the email is between lawyer and client. For such communications, the test is legal advice privilege, not litigation privilege, and its scope is narrower.
Option B is incorrect. Legal advice privilege only protects the parts of the communication that directly seek or provide legal advice. Discussions of purely commercial strategy, even between lawyer and client, are not privileged (Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England (No. 5)).
Option C is incorrect. It states an absolute position which is wrong. In-house lawyers are fully capable of generating legally privileged communications. The privilege depends on the purpose of the communication, not the status of the lawyer.
Option E is incorrect. The privilege of a document (the audit report) is separate from the privilege of a communication about that document. Merely discussing a privileged document in an email does not automatically make the email privileged. The email’s privilege depends on its own content and purpose.


Question 4 (Tort)
A national energy supplier, PowerGrid plc, negligently severs a major underground cable while carrying out street works. This causes a 24-hour power outage across a large industrial estate. As a direct result, Factory A, which operates continuous-process machinery, suffers physical damage to its equipment from sudden shutdown, costing £250,000 to repair. Factory B, next door, has backup generators so its equipment is unharmed. However, it cannot operate for 24 hours and loses profits of £150,000. Factory B sues PowerGrid plc in negligence for its economic loss.
Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding Factory B’s claim?
A.Factory B is likely to succeed because PowerGrid owed a duty of care to all lawful users of the electricity supply, and the loss was a direct and foreseeable consequence of its negligence.
B. Factory B is unlikely to succeed because English law does not generally permit recovery for pure economic loss in negligence unless it arises from a ‘special relationship’ 
C. Factory B is likely to succeed only if it can prove that PowerGrid’s conduct was reckless or intentional, as mere negligence is insufficient to found a duty for pure economic loss.
D. Factory B is unlikely to succeed unless it can show it had a specific contract with PowerGrid for a continuous supply, thereby creating a concurrent duty in tort.
E. Factory B is likely to succeed because the case falls within the principle of Hedley Byrne v Heller, as Factory B relied on PowerGrid’s professional skill and judgement in maintaining the cable.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The established rule from cases like Spartan Steel & Alloys Ltd v Martin & Co (Contractors) Ltd is that, for negligently inflicted pure economic loss (loss unconnected to physical damage to the claimant’s person or property), no duty of care is owed. Exceptions exist for situations involving a ‘special relationship’ of reliance (Hedley Byrne) or where the loss is consequent upon physical damage, but neither applies here. Factory B’s loss is ‘pure’ economic loss.
Option A is incorrect. While duty and foreseeability are established for physical damage (Factory A’s claim), the law deliberately restricts recovery for pure economic loss due to the potential for indeterminate liability to an unlimited class (the ‘floodgates’ argument).
Option C is incorrect. The threshold is not one of reckless or intentional conduct. Even for intentional infliction of economic loss, specific rules apply. The general bar on recovery for negligently caused pure economic loss is a policy-based limitation on the duty of care, not based on the degree of fault.
Option D is incorrect. The existence of a contract might provide a cause of action, but its absence does not determine the tort claim. The tortious duty is limited by common law principles, not by the presence or absence of a parallel contractual relationship.
Option E is incorrect. The Hedley Byrne principle applies to negligent statements or advice leading to economic loss through reasonable reliance. It does not apply to negligent acts (like cutting a cable) that cause physical damage to a third party’s property which in turn causes the claimant’s economic loss.
Question 5 (Professional ethics)
A solicitor, acting for a buyer in a residential property purchase, receives £150,000 from the client by telegraphic transfer on Monday, representing the deposit and the balance of completion monies. Completion is scheduled for Friday. On Tuesday, the solicitor’s firm experiences severe cash flow difficulties due to the delayed payment of several large costs bills. The firm’s Managing Partner, without the client’s knowledge or consent, instructs the accounts department to temporarily transfer £100,000 of the client’s money to the firm’s office account for 48 hours to cover urgent liabilities, intending to return it on Thursday. The transfer is made on Tuesday afternoon.
Which of the following most accurately describes the professional and regulatory consequences of this action?
A. This is a permissible temporary transfer under Rule 5.1(b) of the SRA Accounts Rules 2019, as the money is due to be paid away shortly for the client’s matter and the firm has a genuine shortage of funds.
B. This constitutes a serious breach of the SRA Accounts Rules as client money must be kept separate and must not be used for any purpose other than for that specific client’s matter without proper authority.
C. No breach occurs because the money was only moved between accounts within the same firm and was always intended to be returned before completion, so the client suffered no loss.
D. This is a breach only if the firm fails to return the money by Thursday. If it is returned on time, it is a minor technical breach requiring no further action.
E. This action is primarily a matter of internal accounting and does not engage the SRA Principles, provided the firm records the transfer appropriately in its client ledger.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Rule 5.1 of the SRA Accounts Rules 2019 states that “You must promptly place client money in a client account… and keep it there unless and until it is… properly required for a payment to or on behalf of the client.” Using client money as a temporary loan to cover the firm’s own liabilities is a clear and serious breach of this rule and of the fundamental duty to keep client money safe (SRA Principles 2, 4 and 5). It is akin to misappropriation, regardless of intent to repay.
Option A is incorrect. Rule 5.1(b) allows transfer from client to office account when a properly payable sum is due from the client to the firm (e.g., an agreed fee). It does not permit using client money as a temporary liquidity facility for the firm’s general purposes.
Option C is incorrect. The breach occurs at the moment of improper transfer. The absence of ultimate loss to the client is relevant to compensation but does not negate the serious regulatory breach, which undermines trust in the profession and the protection of client money.
Option D is incorrect. This is not a minor technical breach. It is a fundamental breach of the core obligation to protect client money. The SRA would likely view this as serious misconduct, potentially amounting to a finding of dishonesty, regardless of whether the money was later returned.
Option E is incorrect. The segregation of client money is a cornerstone of legal practice regulation. The action directly engages SRA Principles 2 (public trust), 4 (act with honesty), and 5 (uphold proper service delivery). It is far more than an internal accounting issue.

Question 6 (CONTRACT LAW)
Megan, based in London, sends a signed written offer by first-class post on Monday to sell a rare first-edition book to Leo in Edinburgh for £5,000. The offer letter states, “I will hold this offer open for your acceptance by post for seven days.” Leo receives the letter on Wednesday and immediately writes a letter of acceptance, which he posts at 5:00 pm on Wednesday. Unbeknownst to Leo, Megan sends a fax (which Leo receives) at 4:30 pm on Wednesday revoking her offer. On Thursday morning, Megan receives a higher offer and wishes to sell to another buyer. The acceptance letter from Leo arrives at Megan’s address on Friday.
Which of the following best describes the legal position?
A. No contract exists, as the revocation by fax was effective before Leo posted his acceptance.
B. A contract was formed when Leo posted his acceptance letter on Wednesday.
C. A contract was formed only when Megan received Leo’s acceptance letter on Friday.
D. No contract exists, as the postal rule does not apply to offers which specify a method of acceptance.
E. Megan is bound by a collateral contract to keep the offer open for seven days.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The postal rule (Adams v Lindsell) states that acceptance by post is effective upon posting, provided it was a reasonable and authorised method. Megan’s offer expressly invited acceptance by post, making the postal rule applicable. The revocation, although communicated before Leo received it, was ineffective because it arrived after Leo had already posted his acceptance, which was the moment of contract formation.
Option A is incorrect. For revocation to be effective, it must be communicated to the offeree before they dispatch their acceptance. Here, the revocation fax arrived after Leo had already posted his acceptance at 5:00 pm.
Option C is incorrect. This applies the standard “receipt” rule for instantaneous communication, not the special postal rule which was triggered by the form of the offer.
Option D is incorrect. The postal rule can apply even when the offer stipulates acceptance by post; such a stipulation actually reinforces its application.
Option E is incorrect. While an offeror can be bound by an option contract, a mere statement of how long an offer will be held open is not, without separate consideration, a binding promise.
Question 7 (TORT)
A construction company is subject to the Work at Height Regulations 2005, which impose an absolute duty to ensure that all scaffolding is inspected by a competent person every seven days. The company’s site manager fails to arrange an inspection for nine days. A visiting architect, who is not an employee, trips over a negligently placed loose board on that scaffolding and suffers injury. The architect sues both in common law negligence and for breach of statutory duty.
Regarding the breach of statutory duty claim, which statement is accurate?
A. It will fail because the duty is owed only to employees, not visitors.
B. It will succeed because the breach caused the injury and the statute imposes absolute liability.
C. It will fail because the injury was caused by the loose board, not the lack of inspection.
D. It will succeed only if the architect can prove the missed inspection would have found the defect.
E. It will fail because breach of statutory duty does not give rise to a private right of action.
The correct option is A.
Explanation
Option A is correct. For a claim for breach of statutory duty, the claimant must be a member of the class the statute was intended to protect. Health and safety regulations like the Work at Height Regulations are primarily intended to protect employees and workers, not all visitors (Hartley v Mayoh & Co). The architect, as a visitor, likely falls outside this protected class.
Option B is incorrect. While the duty may be absolute, the claim fails at the preliminary stage because the architect is not within the scope of the statute’s protection.
Option C is incorrect. This confuses causation with the preliminary question of whether a duty is owed to this particular claimant. The ‘scope of the duty’ is a threshold issue.
Option D is incorrect. This addresses causation but presupposes that a duty is owed to the claimant, which it is not.
Option E is incorrect as a blanket statement. Many statutes, including some health and safety regulations, do confer a private right of action, but the claimant must first fall within the protected class.
Question 8 (TORTS)
Elizabeth operates a boutique chemical laboratory on an industrial estate. She stores a large quantity of a specific solvent in a specialized tank. Due to an undetected structural failure in the tank (which occurred despite regular professional maintenance), the solvent leaked into the soil. It traveled underground for several hundred meters and eventually contaminated the private well of Peter, a neighboring organic farmer. Peter is now unable to use his well water for his crops.
Which of the following best describes Elizabeth’s liability under the rule in Rylands v Fletcher?
A.Elizabeth is not liable because the leak was caused by an undetected structural failure rather than her negligence. 
B. Elizabeth is liable because the storage of industrial chemicals is a non-natural use of land, and she is strictly liable for the escape. 
C. Elizabeth is not liable because the solvent remained underground and therefore did not "escape" in the legal sense. 
D. Elizabeth is only liable if Peter can prove that she failed to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the tank. 
E.Elizabeth is not liable because the rule in Rylands v Fletcher only applies to the escape of water.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under Rylands v Fletcher, liability is strict. It does not matter that Elizabeth was not negligent (Option A and D are incorrect). Industrial chemicals stored in large quantities on an industrial estate are considered a "non-natural use" (Cambridge Water v Eastern Counties Leather), and the solvent "escaped" from her control to Peter’s land. 
Option C is incorrect. An escape occurs whenever the substance moves from the defendant’s land to a place outside their control; traveling underground still counts as an escape. 
Option E is incorrect. While the original case involved water, the rule has been applied to many things, including chemicals, gas, and even gypsies (Att-Gen v Corke).

Question 9 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
A claimant’s solicitor issues a claim form on 1st October. The rules require service within 4 months. On 2nd February (the last day of the 4-month period), the solicitor sends the claim form to the defendant’s usual residential address by first-class post. The defendant is abroad on holiday and does not actually receive the form until 10th February. The defendant argues the claim was not served in time.
Is the claim form deemed to be served in time?
A. No, because the defendant did not receive it within the 4-month period.
B. Yes, because service is deemed effective on the second business day after posting.
C. No, because first-class post is not a permitted method of service on an individual.
D. Yes, because the solicitor took all reasonable steps to serve within the period.
E. No, because the claimant should have applied for an order for alternative service.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under CPR 6.14, where a claim form is served by first-class post, the deemed date of service is the second business day after posting, regardless of actual receipt. Posted on 2nd February, deemed service would be on 4th or 5th February (depending on business days), which is within the 4-month period calculated from 1st October.
Option A is incorrect. The CPR operates a deemed service regime; actual receipt date is irrelevant for calculating compliance with the time limit for service.
Option C is incorrect. First-class post is a permitted standard method of service on an individual at their usual residence (CPR 6.3(1)(b) & PD 6A).
Option D is incorrect. The test is not one of reasonable steps but of strict compliance with the deemed service rules in the CPR.
Option E is incorrect. An order for alternative service is for difficult cases; standard service by post was available and was used correctly here.
Question 10 ( CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW)
A national environmental charity with 50,000 members seeks judicial review of a government minister’s decision to grant a licence for a new nuclear power station. The charity argues the decision was irrational and failed to consider certain environmental impacts. The charity itself owns no land near the site and its members are spread nationwide. The government applies to have the claim struck out for lack of standing.
How is the court most likely to approach the question of the charity’s standing?
A. Refuse standing, as the charity has no direct, personal interest affected greater than the public at large.
B. Grant standing, as charities automatically have sufficient interest in matters within their charitable objects.
C. Grant standing, as the claim raises issues of public importance requiring adjudication.
D. Refuse standing, as only individuals residing in the immediate locality can challenge such decisions.
E. Grant standing, provided the charity can show a substantial number of its members are directly affected.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Following R v Inspectorate of Pollution, ex p Greenpeace Ltd (No 2), the courts adopt a flexible approach to standing (sufficient interest) in public law, particularly for representative groups. Where a responsible and knowledgeable claimant with a genuine interest in the issue raises a serious, arguable point of public importance, the court is likely to grant standing, even absent direct personal affectation.
Option A is incorrect. This states the traditional test too rigidly. The modern test is more flexible, especially for representative bodies.
Option B is incorrect. Charitable status does not confer automatic standing; the court must still be satisfied of a ‘sufficient interest’ in the context of the specific challenge.
Option D is incorrect. This is an outdated restriction. The law recognizes that national bodies with expertise can have a legitimate interest in decisions with national implications.
Option E is incorrect. While such a showing might strengthen the case, it is not a strict prerequisite. The court focuses on the nature of the issue and the appropriateness of the claimant as a challenger.

Question 11 (CONTRACT LAW)
A supermarket displays a rare, collectable vintage wine on its shelves with a price tag of £75. Colin, a collector, takes the bottle to the checkout. The cashier scans it and the system shows a price of £850. The manager is called and explains the £75 tag was a stocking error; the correct price is £850. Colin insists he is entitled to buy it for £75. The supermarket refuses to sell at that price.
Is the supermarket entitled to refuse the sale at £75?
A. No, because displaying the goods with a price constitutes an offer to sell at that price.
B. Yes, because the display of goods is not an offer.
C. No, because the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 prohibit misleading pricing.
D. Yes, but only if they can prove the error was genuine and not a deliberate sales tactic.
E. No, because the customer’s act of presenting the goods at checkout is an acceptance.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The fundamental rule in Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots is that the display of goods on a shelf is an invitation to treat, not an offer. The offer is made by the customer at the checkout, which the supermarket is free to accept or reject. The price tag is an invitation to negotiate.
Option A is incorrect. This misstates the basic rule; a display is not an offer.
Option C is incorrect. While the Regulations may impose other penalties for misleading pricing, they do not alter the underlying contract law principle that no offer has been made by the supermarket.
Option D is incorrect. The reason for the error is irrelevant to the contractual analysis; the supermarket has the legal right to refuse the customer’s offer for any reason.
Option E is incorrect. Presenting goods is part of making an offer, not acceptance. The supermarket’s acceptance occurs at the till when they agree to the price.
Question 12 (Contract)
TechSoft Ltd enters into a contract with DesignerPro Ltd for the creation of a custom software interface for £50,000, payable in two instalments: £25,000 upfront and £25, upon delivery. TechSoft pays the £25,000 deposit. Two weeks later, before DesignerPro has begun any substantive work, TechSoft discovers that DesignerPro has materially misrepresented its technical capabilities. TechSoft rightfully terminates the contract for misrepresentation. DesignerPro has provided no benefit whatsoever. TechSoft seeks to recover its £25,000.
On what basis is TechSoft most likely to recover the prepayment?
A. As damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, which requires proof of dishonesty.
B. As a debt due under the contract, as the termination clause provides for repayment.
C. In restitution on the ground of total failure of consideration.
D. As compensation for wasted expenditure (reliance loss).
E. Under the principle of quantum meruit, for work actually done.
The correct option is C.
Explanation:
Option C is correct. Where a contract is terminated for misrepresentation (or breach), the innocent party may have a claim in restitution for money paid if there has been a total failure of consideration. The "consideration" here refers to the promised performance, not the legal sense of bargained-for-exchange. TechSoft paid for a software interface; it received nothing of what it paid for. The failure of consideration is total, giving rise to a right to restitution of the money paid to prevent DesignerPro's unjust enrichment (Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd).
Option A is incorrect. While a claim for damages for misrepresentation exists, restitution for total failure of consideration is a distinct, strict liability claim that does not require proof of fault or dishonesty. It is often a quicker route to recovery in these circumstances.
Option B is incorrect. The facts do not indicate a contractual repayment clause.
Option D is incorrect. A claim for reliance loss is a claim for damages aiming to put TechSoft in the position it would have been in had the contract not been made. Restitution aims to give back a benefit conferred. Here, the direct claim for the return of the money is restitutionary.
Option E is incorrect. Quantum meruit (a claim for the reasonable value of services rendered) applies where a benefit has been conferred. Here, no work was done, so no quantum meruit claim arises.
Question 13 (BUSINESS LAW)
Emma, a director of EcoBuild Ltd, learns of a lucrative property development opportunity through her role. She calculates that she can benefit as much as £10 million from the opportunity. She does not disclose it to the board. Instead, she resigns her directorship and the next day, through a company she owns, enters into a contract to purchase the development land. She benefits £20 million from the opportunity. EcoBuild Ltd later discovers this and wishes to claim the profit.
Which of the following best describes the Emma’s appropriate response to the situation?
A. A director can freely exploit any opportunity after resignation.
B. A director must avoid conflicts which can include opportunities exploited after resignation if based on information from their role.
C. The duty to avoid conflicts only applies during the tenure of the directorship.
D. The company can only claim if the director failed to declare the interest prior to resignation.
E. The duty is not breached if the company could not have afforded the opportunity itself.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Section 175 imposes a duty to avoid conflicts of interest. Case law (Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley) establishes that this duty can extend to opportunities the director became aware of during their tenure, even if exploited after resignation, if the opportunity properly belongs to the company.
Option A is incorrect. This is too broad and contradicted by case law. Post-resignation exploitation can still be a breach.
Option C is incorrect. The duty can have a continuing effect regarding information and opportunities obtained during office.
Option D is incorrect. Declaration does not necessarily legitimise taking the opportunity for oneself; board authorisation is typically required.
Option E is incorrect. The company’s financial ability is generally irrelevant to the existence of the conflict and the breach of duty.
Question 14 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Charlotte, a technology investor, brings a claim for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty against David, a former business partner, alleging he misappropriated substantial company funds and transferred them through a complex network of international accounts. Fearing David will dissipate these assets, Charlotte’s lawyers make an urgent ex parte (without notice) application for a Worldwide Freezing Order (WFO). In her evidence supporting the application, Charlotte emphasises the sophisticated nature of the alleged fraud and the clear risk that David will hide the assets if given notice. The court, relying on this ex parte evidence, grants the WFO.
At the subsequent return hearing, where both parties are present, David’s counsel argues the order should be discharged. He reveals that, several weeks before the WFO application, David’s solicitors had written to Charlotte’s solicitors offering to place a sum of £2 million, representing a significant portion of the disputed funds into a solicitor-managed escrow account pending the trial’s outcome. Charlotte had rejected this offer without making the court aware of its existence during the ex parte hearing.
David argues that this rejected offer was a critical fact that undermined the assertion of an immediate and unaddressed risk of dissipation, which is the very foundation for granting the freezing order.
What is the likely consequence of this non-disclosure?
A. The court is likely to discharge the WFO for material non-disclosure.
B. The court will ignore it as the offer was without prejudice.
C. The court will vary the order but not discharge it, as the offer showed some assets were secure.
D. The court will uphold the order because the duty of full and frank disclosure only applies to facts, not offers.
E. The court will only discharge the order if David proves Charlotte acted in bad faith.
The correct option is A.
Explanation
Option A is correct. The duty of full and frank disclosure (or uberrimae fidei) on an ex parte application is stringent and uncompromising. The fact that David had previously offered to secure a significant sum in escrow is highly material, as it goes directly to the court’s assessment of the risk of dissipation, the core justification for the draconian WFO. By failing to disclose this offer and its rejection, Charlotte deprived the judge of key information necessary to conduct a fair balancing exercise. Such a material non-disclosure typically merits the discharge of the order as a matter of principle, to uphold the integrity of the ex parte process, regardless of the ultimate merits of the claim (Brink’s Mat Ltd v Elcombe).
Option B is incorrect. While the content of settlement negotiations may often be ‘without prejudice,’ the existence of an offer to secure assets is a material fact that the court must know. Privilege may not apply to the fact of the offer in this context, and even if it did, the applicant must typically flag the issue to the judge.
Option C is incorrect. Although the court has a discretion to maintain the order with variations (e.g., Tibbles v SIG plc), a non-disclosure touching on the central pillar of the application (risk of dissipation) is so serious that the usual remedy is discharge. The court’s discretion is exercised to protect the process, not merely to remedy the oversight.
Option D is incorrect. The duty extends to all material facts, which unequivocally includes relevant communications and offers between the parties that could influence the court’s decision on whether to grant the extraordinary remedy.
Option E is incorrect. While proof of bad faith would be damning, the duty is strict. An innocent or even negligent omission of a material fact can, and often will, lead to discharge. The court’s primary concern is the integrity of its own process.
Question 15 (CONTRACT LAW)
Builder Co agrees to construct a garden office for Homeowner for a fixed price of £30,000. After Builder Co has completed 60% of the work (at a cost to them of £16,000), Homeowner wrongfully repudiates the contract by unlawfully refusing access to the site. Builder Co accepts the repudiation, terminating the contract. The contract is silent on payment for work done in the event of wrongful termination. The part-built structure benefits Homeowner by increasing the value of her property.
In addition to a claim for damages for breach, what alternative restitutionary claim is available to Builder Co?
A. A claim for the full contract price of £30,000 as a debt.
B. A claim in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of the work done, which may differ from the contract rate.
C. A claim for the return of materials incorporated into the land, as they remain Builder Co's property.
D. No restitutionary claim is available; Builder Co's sole remedy is damages for lost profit on the entire contract.
E. A claim for the deposit, as the failure of consideration is total.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. Where a contract is terminated for the other party's breach, the innocent party has an election. Alongside a claim for damages for breach, they may claim in restitution for the value of the benefit conferred on the defendant. This is a quantum meruit claim (meaning "as much as he deserved"). The measure is the reasonable value of the work done, which is assessed objectively and may be more or less than the contract rate, based on the benefit to the homeowner (Lodder v Slowey). Damages and restitution are alternative remedies; the claimant cannot recover both in full for the same loss.

Option A is incorrect. The contract has been terminated, so the obligation to pay the full price is discharged. The claim is for compensation for the breach (damages) or for the value of the benefit conferred (restitution), not the contract debt.
Option C is incorrect. Once materials are fixed to the land, they generally become part of the freehold and belong to the landowner. A proprietary claim is unlikely to succeed.
Option D is incorrect. While damages for lost profit are a primary remedy, the law provides the alternative restitutionary route to prevent the homeowner being unjustly enriched by receiving and retaining the benefit of the work without paying for it.
Option E is incorrect. The failure of consideration is not total, a significant benefit (60% of the work) has been conferred. Total failure is required for simple recovery of money paid; here, the claim is for the value of services rendered.
Question 16 (CONTRACT LAW)
Chloe and her uncle David have a close family relationship. David, a successful property developer, tells Chloe over Sunday dinner, "Don't worry about your student loans. I'll cover the monthly payments for you until you finish your master's degree next year." 
Relying on this, Chloe declines a part-time job offer. Two months later, David suffers business losses and informs Chloe he can no longer make the payments. Chloe, now in financial difficulty, wishes to enforce her uncle's promise.
In a claim for breach of contract, what is the central legal issue?
A. Whether adequate consideration was provided by Chloe.
B. Whether the promise was sufficiently certain in its terms.
C. Whether the parties had an intention to create legal relations.
D. Whether the promise was made in a deed under seal.
E. Whether there was a valid offer and acceptance.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The central issue in family or domestic agreements is the presumption against an intention to create legal relations (Balfour v Balfour). The court will examine the context, including the relationship, the nature of the promise, and reliance, to determine if this presumption is rebutted. Here, the familial context is key, making the intention to be legally bound the primary hurdle.
Option A is incorrect. While consideration is a necessary element, the preliminary and often decisive issue in such familial settings is the intention to create legal relations. If no intention is found, the matter of consideration does not arise.
Option B is incorrect. Certainty is a separate contractual requirement. However, the promise, while vague in duration, could be rendered certain. The fundamental barrier is the familial context giving rise to the presumption against legal intent.
Option D is incorrect. The use of a deed would circumvent the need for consideration and could demonstrate formal intent, but the promise here was oral and informal, making this point irrelevant.
Option E is incorrect. While offer and acceptance are foundational, they are assumed in this scenario. The contentious and primary legal filter for enforcing such a familial promise is the parties' intention to be legally bound.
Question 17 (TORTS)
Liam, an experienced cyclist, agrees to join a weekly road-racing training session with a local club. He signs a detailed participation waiver that explicitly states, "I acknowledge and accept the inherent risks of competitive cycling, including the risk of collision and serious injury due to the negligence of other participants." During a fast-paced sprint, another cyclist, Finn, negligently swerves into Liam's path, causing Liam to crash and suffer a complex leg fracture. Liam sues Finn in negligence. Finn raises the defence of volenti non fit injuria .
What is the principal factor the court will consider regarding this defence?
A. Whether the waiver document is a legally binding contract.
B. Whether Liam had actual, subjective knowledge of the specific risk that materialised.
C. Whether a reasonable person in Liam's position would have understood the general risk.
D. Whether the injury occurred within the scope of the activity covered by the waiver.
E. Whether the defendant's negligence amounted to recklessness.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. For the complete defence of volenti to succeed, the claimant must have had full, subjective knowledge of the precise risk and, with that knowledge, expressly or impliedly agreed to absolve the defendant of liability for injury caused by that risk (Morris v Murray). The court will scrutinise whether Liam truly consented to the negligent acts of others, not just the inherent risks of the sport. This is a very high bar.
Option A is incorrect. A contractual waiver operates separately from the tort defence of volenti. The contractual question is distinct from whether Liam voluntarily assumed the tortious risk.
Option C is incorrect. This is the test for the defence of contributory negligence, which is a partial defence based on the objective standard of the reasonable person. Volenti requires a subjective analysis.
Option D is incorrect. The core of volenti is the claimant's consent to the breach of duty, not just participation in a risky activity.
Option E is incorrect. The degree of fault (negligence vs. recklessness) can be relevant, but the central question remains the claimant's consent to the specific risk of the defendant's negligent conduct.
Question 18 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
TechStart Ltd, a small claimant company with nominal share capital, is bringing a substantial High Court claim against MegaCorp plc for breach of a software licence agreement. TechStart Ltd is registered in England but its sole director and shareholder, Ethan, is resident in New Zealand with no assets in the jurisdiction. TechStart Ltd's financial statements show it is marginally solvent. MegaCorp applies for an order that TechStart Ltd provide security for its costs.
On which of the following grounds is MegaCorp most likely to succeed in its application?
A. The claimant company is based outside the jurisdiction.
B. The claimant company is insolvent or impecunious.
C. The claimant company is a nominal claimant with no substantial assets.
D. There is reason to believe the claimant company will be unable to pay the defendant's costs if ordered to do so.
E. The claim has a low probability of success.
The correct option is D.
Explanation
Option D is correct. CPR 25.13 allows the court to order security for costs if, inter alia, "it is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that it is just to make such an order" and one of the conditions in (2) is met. Condition (c) is that "the claimant is a company… and there is reason to believe it will be unable to pay the defendant's costs if ordered to do so." The company's marginal solvency and the director's lack of UK assets provide the required "reason to believe."
Option A is incorrect. The company is registered in England; its place of incorporation is within the jurisdiction, so this common ground does not apply.
Option B is incorrect. Impecuniosity alone is not a ground; the rule focuses on the company's inability to pay costs if ordered, not its general poverty. Furthermore, the court is cautious not to stifle a genuine claim by an impecunious company.
Option C is incorrect. This is vague. The rule looks specifically at the company's inability to pay future costs, not just its current asset level in isolation.
Option E is incorrect. The merits of the claim are a separate discretionary factor the court will consider after a ground under 25.13(2) is established. Low probability of success alone is not a standalone ground for security.
Question 19 (BUSINESS LAW)
Zara is the sole director of "GreenLeaf Innovations Ltd," a company that installs solar panels. The company enters into a contract with a homeowner, Mr. Brown, for an installation. During the work, Zara, who is personally supervising, gives a clear instruction to an employee that negligently bypasses a key safety regulator to finish the job faster. This causes a fire that damages Mr. Brown's house. The company has no assets or insurance. Mr. Brown wishes to sue Zara personally for the tort of negligence.
What is the key legal principle determining Zara's potential personal liability?
A. Directors are always personally liable for torts committed by their companies.
B. The corporate veil prevents any personal liability for directors acting as the company.
C. A director can be personally liable if they assumed personal responsibility or committed a separate, personal tort.
D. Personal liability only arises if the director benefited financially from the tort.
E. A director is only liable if the company is found to be insolvent.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The principle of separate corporate personality generally protects directors from personal liability for company torts. However, a director can be personally liable if they themselves commit a tort, or if they assume personal responsibility such that a duty of care is owed by them personally (Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd). Here, Zara's direct, personal instruction that constituted the negligent act is likely sufficient to establish her own personal breach of duty.
Option A is incorrect. This is a vast overstatement. The core principle of Salomon v Salomon is that a company is a separate legal entity. Directors are not automatically liable for its torts.
Option B is incorrect. The corporate veil can be pierced in rare circumstances, but personal liability in tort often arises alongside the company's liability without needing to pierce the veil, based on the director's own actions.
Option D is incorrect. A personal benefit may be evidence of a breach of duty, but it is not a necessary condition for establishing personal liability in negligence.
Option E is incorrect. The company's solvency is irrelevant to the question of whether the director committed a personal tort. It is only relevant to the practical question of enforcement.
Question 20 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
The dispute resolution team at "Harrison Legal" is handling a high-volume caseload of fast-track personal injury claims. To improve efficiency, a partner delegates the initial drafting of a defence to a counterclaim in a complex matter to a newly qualified solicitor, Anna. The partner gives Anna the key pleadings to review but provides no specific guidance on the relevant legal tests for establishing a counterclaim in tort and does not set a clear deadline for reviewing her work. 

Under significant time pressure from other files, Anna drafts the defence and counterclaim, but mistakenly omits a crucial element of causation, rendering the counterclaim legally flawed. The partner, who is listed as the designated supervisor, signs the statement of truth and serves the documents without conducting a substantive review, relying on Anna's general competence. The error is later spotted by the opposing party, who applies to strike out the counterclaim.

Which party has most clearly breached the SRA Code of Conduct ?

A.Anna, the newly qualified solicitor, has breached the code by failing to exercise the competence and diligence expected of her qualification.
B.The opposing party has breached the code by applying to strike out the counterclaim instead of first seeking to have it amended.
C.The firm itself has breached the code by failing to ensure that the partner provided adequate supervision to Anna.
D.The client has breached the code by instructing a firm that was clearly under-resourced to handle their complex dispute.
E.The partner alone has breached the code by signing the statement of truth without a proper review, and the firm bears no responsibility for his individual act.

C is the correct option.

Explanation

C is the correct option. The SRA Code of Conduct for Firms requires firms to have effective systems for supervising clients' matters. This includes ensuring that work is properly supervised and that managers are responsible for the work carried out under their authority. The firm failed in its duty by allowing a culture or practice where a partner could delegate complex work to a junior without providing guidance, setting a review timeline, or conducting a substantive check before filing. The firm is responsible for creating an environment where such inadequate supervision can occur, which directly impacts the quality of work in dispute resolution.

A is incorrect. While Anna may have made an error, the primary regulatory breach lies with the system of supervision. The firm and the supervising partner have a duty to ensure that junior staff are properly guided and that their work is checked, especially on complex matters and when they are newly qualified.

B is incorrect. The opposing party is entitled to use available legal procedures to challenge a defective pleading. Their actions do not constitute a breach of the SRA Code of Conduct.

D is incorrect. The client has no regulatory obligations under the SRA Code of Conduct for Firms. The duty to resource matters appropriately lies entirely with the law firm.

E is incorrect. The firm is responsible for the conduct of its managers and employees in the course of their work. The partner's failure is, by extension, a failure of the firm's systems and culture, for which the entity is accountable to the regulator.

Question 21 (CONTRACT)
Noah owes his supplier, Elijah, £15,000 for goods delivered, due for payment on 1st March. On 28th February, Noah contacts Elijah, explaining he is in severe financial difficulty and can only pay £10,000 immediately. He says, "This is all I can pay. If you want it, you must take it in full and final settlement." Elijah, worried Noah might become insolvent, agrees and accepts the £10,000 bank transfer on that basis. In April, Noah's finances improve. Elijah now demands the remaining £5,000.
Can Elijah successfully recover the £5,000 balance?
A. No, because his agreement amounted to an accord and satisfaction.
B. Yes, because Noah provided no fresh consideration for the promise to forgo the balance.
C. No, because Elijah obtained a practical benefit from receiving the early payment.
D. Yes, because the agreement was not made under seal as a deed.
E. No, because the debt was disputed in good faith.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The long-standing rule in Foakes v Beer, reaffirmed in MWB Business Exchange v Rock Advertising, is that payment of a lesser sum on the due date is not good consideration for a promise to forgo the balance. The fear of insolvency is not, in itself, legally sufficient fresh consideration or a practical benefit to the creditor in this context. Therefore, Elijah’s promise is not binding, and the original debt remains enforceable for the balance.
Option A is incorrect. Accord and satisfaction requires valid consideration. Here, there is no consideration for the accord, so it fails.
Option C is incorrect. While Williams v Roffey introduced the concept of practical benefit for promises to pay more, it does not generally apply to promises to accept less from a debtor (Re Selectmove).
Option D is incorrect. While a deed would make the promise binding, its absence does not automatically make the debtor's promise enforceable; the issue is the lack of consideration.
Option E is incorrect. The scenario does not indicate the debt was disputed; it was an admitted debt where the debtor pleaded inability to pay in full.
Question 22 (TORTS)
Maya is a care worker employed by "HomeCare Ltd" to visit elderly clients. While driving her own car between scheduled client visits during work hours, she decides to make a significant detour to visit her own mother, which is against company policy. During this detour, she negligently crashes into another vehicle, injuring the driver, Leo. Leo sues HomeCare Ltd, arguing it is vicariously liable for Maya’s negligence.
What is the decisive test for vicarious liability in this scenario?
A. Whether the employee was employed by Homecare Ltd
B. Whether the employer authorised the specific act of negligence.
C. Whether the employee’s conduct was closely connected to their employment.
D. Whether the employer could have prevented the negligence with proper training.
E. Whether the employee was using their own vehicle.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The modern test for vicarious liability, established in cases like Lister v Hesley Hall and Mohamud v WM Morrison Supermarkets, is whether the wrongful conduct was so closely connected with acts the employee was authorised to do that it may fairly and properly be regarded as done in the course of their employment. The detour for a personal errand makes this connection weak, likely placing the act outside the course of employment. Therefore A is incorrect
Option B is incorrect. Authorisation of the specific wrongful act is not required; the test is based on the connection of the type of act to the employment.
Option D is incorrect. This relates to a potential direct liability for negligent training, not the strict liability of vicarious liability for the employee's tort.
Option E is incorrect. The use of a personal vehicle is a factor but not determinative. An employee can be acting in the course of employment while using their own car (e.g., on a permissible business journey).
Question 23 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Daniel issued a claim form against Chloe for breach of contract. Chloe received it but was preoccupied with a family emergency and failed to file an acknowledgment of service or a defence within the required time. Daniel properly obtained a default judgment. Two weeks later, Chloe seeks to set the judgment aside. She has filed evidence of the family crisis and has a draft defence which shows a reasonably arguable case on the merits.
What is the two-stage test the court will apply?
A. Whether the failure to respond was intentional and whether the defence has a real prospect of success.
B. Whether there was a good reason for the default and whether the claimant would suffer prejudice.
C. Whether the defendant has acted promptly and whether there is a good reason for the default.
D. Whether there is a good reason for the default and whether the defendant has a real prospect of successfully defending the claim.
E. Whether the judgment was regularly obtained and whether the defendant has any merit in their application.
The correct option is D.
Explanation
Option D is correct. Under CPR 13.3, the court may set aside a default judgment if (a) the defendant has a real prospect of successfully defending the claim, OR (b) there is some other good reason to do so. The court will also consider whether the defendant applied promptly. While good reason for the default is relevant, the existence of a meritorious defence is often the decisive factor.
Option A is incorrect. The defendant's intention is relevant but not the primary statutory test. A negligent but unintentional failure may still be set aside if there is a good defence.
Option B is incorrect. Prejudice to the claimant is a discretionary factor the court may consider, but it is not part of the core two-stage test under CPR 13.3.
Option C is incorrect. Promptness is a mandatory consideration but is not one of the two main grounds (defence on merits or other good reason).
Option E is incorrect. Whether the judgment was regularly obtained is a separate issue (under CPR 13.2); if irregular, it must be set aside. Here, it was regular, so the test under CPR 13.3 applies.
Question 24 (BUSINESS LAW)
Luna is the CEO and a director of "Starlight Designs Ltd," a private company. The board (including Luna) approves the sale of the company's only warehouse to Luna's husband, Tom, for £120,000. The company's latest balance sheet shows net assets of £1.1 million. An independent valuation states the warehouse's market value is £125,000. The company’s articles are based on the Model Articles. Shareholder approval for the transaction has not been sought.
What is the legal consequence of the proceeding ?
A. The transaction is void and of no legal effect.
B. The transaction is voidable at the instance of the company.
C. The transaction is valid because it was approved by the board at fair value.
D. The transaction is valid if it is ratified by the board after full disclosure.
E. The transaction is unlawful and constitutes a criminal offence by the director.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Section 190 of the Companies Act 2006 requires member approval for a substantial property transaction between a company and a director (or a person connected to a director, such as a spouse). A transaction made without the required approval is voidable by the company (s.195), unless restitution is impossible or rights of third parties intervene.
Option A is incorrect. The transaction is voidable, not automatically void. This gives the company the option to affirm or avoid it.
Option C is incorrect. Board approval and fair value do not circumvent the statutory requirement for member approval for a substantial transaction with a connected person.
Option D is incorrect. Ratification by the board is insufficient; the statute specifically requires approval by the members.
Option E is incorrect. While breaching the duty to avoid conflicts (s.175) may be involved, the specific consequence under s.190 for lack of approval is civil (voidability), not automatically criminal.
Question 25 (LEGAL SERVICES)
Solicitor Arjun is conducting due diligence for a client, Felix, who is purchasing a luxury property. Arjun receives the source of funds information, which shows a large deposit originated from a wire transfer from an offshore bank in a high-risk jurisdiction. When questioned, Felix becomes evasive and changes his story. Arjun’s internal risk assessment flags serious suspicion of money laundering. He submits a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) to the National Crime Agency and its been 8 days since the report was submitted.
After submitting the SAR, what must Arjun do regarding the transaction?
A. Proceed with the transaction unless  the NCA issues a Moratorium Notice denying consent.
B. Cease all work on the transaction immediately to avoid committing a prohibited act.
C. Inform Felix that a SAR has been filed and then continue with his instructions.
D. Seek the court's permission to continue acting, as he is now conflicted.
E. End the transaction unless the NCA contacts him within ten working days.
The correct option is A.
Explanation
Option A is correct. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (as amended), once a SAR is submitted, the reporter must not proceed with the transaction if doing so would constitute a "prohibited act." They must wait for the statutory period. If the NCA does not respond with a refusal of consent (a "Moratorium Notice") within seven working days, consent is deemed given, and they may proceed. They must not "tip off" the client.
Option B is incorrect. An immediate and complete cessation is not the statutory process. The solicitor must pause only for the prescribed period to await the NCA's response.
Option C is incorrect. Informing the client that a SAR has been filed is likely to constitute the offence of "tipping off," which is prohibited under POCA.
Option D is incorrect. This is not a standard procedure. The process is governed by the statutory framework of POCA and NCA reporting, not by an application to the court. Option E is incorrect. 

Question 26 (CONTRACT)
Ava posts on a community social media page: “£500 reward for the safe return of my lost ginger cat, Whiskers. Last seen near the park. Please bring him to my home.” Ben sees the post. Two days later, while walking his dog, he finds a distressed ginger cat trapped in a drain near the park. He rescues it and, believing it to be Whiskers, takes it straight to Ava’s house. Upon arrival, Ava immediately says, “That’s not my cat,” and refuses to pay. It is later confirmed the cat is a similar-looking stray. Ben sues for the reward.
Is Ava contractually liable to pay Ben the £500?
A. Yes, because Ben performed the requested act of returning a lost cat.
B. No, because Ben did not return the specific cat, Whiskers.
C. Yes, because the offer was an open promise to the world.
D. No, because Ben did not provide communication of his acceptance.
E. Yes, because Ben acted in reliance on the offer.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. A reward offer for the return of a specific lost item creates a unilateral contract. Acceptance occurs only upon full and precise performance of the terms stipulated in the offer (Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co). The offer was for the return of “my lost ginger cat, Whiskers.” Ben’s performance (returning a different cat) did not match the terms of the offer, so no contract was formed.
Option A is incorrect. While Ben performed an act, he did not perform the act specified in the offer, which was the return of the particular cat, Whiskers.
Option C is incorrect. An offer can be made to the world, but it is still only accepted by complete performance of its precise conditions, which did not occur here.
Option D is incorrect. In a unilateral contract, acceptance is typically through performance, not prior communication. The failure was one of performance, not communication.
Option E is incorrect. Promissory estoppel or reliance principles do not apply here to create a contract where the essential terms of the offer have not been met.
Question 27 (TORT)
Daniel is waiting at a school gate to collect his young nephew, Leo, when he witnesses a van mounted on the pavement, striking and killing a child. Daniel believes the child to be Leo and suffers an immediate shock, developing a severe recognised psychiatric illness. It transpires the victim was another child. Daniel was not in any personal physical danger. He sues the van driver for his psychiatric injury.
What is the fundamental barrier to Daniel’s claim?
A. He was not physically injured in the event.
B. He was not present at the immediate aftermath.
C. He was not a close relative of the primary victim.
D. He was not in fear for his own safety.
E. His perception of the event was mistaken.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. For a secondary victim claiming for psychiatric injury (nervous shock), the Alcock criteria require a close tie of love and affection with the primary victim. The law typically recognises such ties in immediate family relationships (spouse, parent, child). The relationship of uncle/nephew is not presumed to be sufficiently close; Daniel would need to prove it with evidence, which is a significant hurdle and the fundamental issue here.
Option A is incorrect. Physical injury is not required for a secondary victim claim; psychiatric injury is the damage claimed.
Option B is incorrect. He was present at the event itself, which satisfies the proximity in time and space requirement. The "aftermath" principle applies where the shock comes from seeing the immediate consequences.
Option D is incorrect. Fear for one’s own safety would make him a primary victim (Page v Smith). As a secondary victim, the shock must come from witnessing injury to another.
Option E is incorrect. While his belief was mistaken, the key is the relationship to the actual victim. Even if it had been Leo, the uncle/nephew relationship would still require proof of closeness.
Question 28 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
Rebecca, a director of Summit Developments, has been monitoring a high-stakes planning application for a new out-of-town retail park submitted by a direct competitor. On 1 May, the Secretary of State issues a formal decision letter granting outline planning permission for the project.
Rebecca is convinced the decision is legally flawed because the Secretary of State failed to consider the "material consideration" of the project's impact on the local high street's heritage status. She immediately instructs her legal team to prepare a claim for Judicial Review. However, due to a combination of a bank holiday weekend, a delay in obtaining an expert heritage report, and her lead solicitor being away on a pre-planned holiday, the claim form is not finalized until mid-June.
Rebecca finally files the claim form at the Administrative Court on 20 June. She argues that she has acted with reasonable speed for such a complex matter and is well within the standard time limit she has heard applies to public law challenges.
Has Rebecca filed her claim within the required time limit?
A.Yes, because she is within the standard three-month period for judicial review.
B.  No, because the time limit for judicial review of a decision under the planning acts is six weeks.
C.  Yes, provided she can show that the delay of nearly seven weeks was due to her solicitors being on holiday. 
D.No, because planning challenges must be brought within 30 days. 
E.Yes, because time does not start to run until the decision is physically published in a local newspaper.
Option B is correct
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under CPR 54.5(5), there is a specific shorter time limit for judicial reviews relating to decisions made under the planning acts. The claim form must be filed not later than six weeks after the grounds first arose. Since 1 May to 20 June is roughly seven weeks, Rebecca is out of time. 
Option A is incorrect. The standard three-month limit is overridden by specific statutory shorter limits (e.g., planning and procurement). 
Option D is incorrect. The 30-day limit typically applies to Public Procurement cases (CPR 54.5(6)).
Question 29 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
On a rainy Tuesday morning in November, Eva was walking to a client meeting in a busy downtown area. She was crossing at a marked pedestrian crossing, with the "walk" signal clearly in her favour. Noah, driving his company van, was running late for a job estimate. He was momentarily distracted by a notification on his dashboard-mounted phone regarding a delayed materials delivery. As he approached the intersection, he saw the traffic light turn amber and accelerated, hoping to pass through before it turned red. He failed to notice Eva stepping onto the crossing.
Noah’s van struck Eva. She was thrown onto the bonnet and then to the wet pavement. The impact was severe enough to dent the van’s front wing. In the personal injury claim, claimant Eva makes a Part 36 offer to settle for £90,000. Defendant Noah makes a subsequent Part 36 offer to settle for £60,000. Both offers expire. At trial, Eva is awarded £92,000. The trial judge finds Eva acted reasonably in refusing Noah’s lower offer.
What are the automatic costs consequences?
A. Eva is entitled to her costs on the indemnity basis from the expiry of her own offer.
B. Eva is entitled to her costs on the standard basis, plus enhanced interest.
C. Noah is liable for Eva’s costs on the indemnity basis from the expiry of his offer.
D. The normal costs rules apply, as the defendant’s offer was more advantageous.
E. Eva gets her costs, and Noah gets his costs after the date of his offer.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. CPR 36.17(4) sets out the consequences where a claimant obtains a judgment that is more advantageous than their own Part 36 offer. The claimant is entitled to: (a) costs on the indemnity basis from the date the offer expired, and (b) interest on those costs and on damages at an enhanced rate (up to 10% above base). The defendant’s offer is irrelevant because Eva beat her own, more advantageous, offer.
Option A is incorrect. It omits the crucial additional consequence of enhanced interest on damages and costs.
Option C is incorrect. These consequences apply when a defendant beats their own offer, which did not happen here as the judgment (£92k) was better than Noah’s offer (£60k).
Option D is incorrect. The normal rules are displaced by the claimant beating her own Part 36 offer, triggering the enhanced consequences.
Option E is incorrect. There is no basis for the defendant to get any costs, as the claimant was the overall winner and beat her own offer.
Question 30 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
Solicitor Liam acts for husband, Ben, in negotiating a post-nuptial separation agreement. The wife, Jessica, approaches Liam’s firm seeking representation in the same matter. Jessica is unaware Liam acts for Ben. Liam’s firm runs a conflict check, identifies the parties are married, but notes the firm has never acted for Jessica before. The fee earner who would act for Jessica is in a different department and there would be no sharing of information.
According to the SRA Code, can the firm act for Jessica?
A. Yes, provided both Ben and Jessica give their informed consent.
B. Yes, because the fee earners are in separate departments with information barriers.
C. No, because the clients have a conflicting interest in the same matter.
D. No, because Ben is an existing client and the firm owes him a duty of loyalty.
E. Yes, because the firm has no relevant confidential information about Jessica.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Paragraph 6.2 of the SRA Code of Conduct prohibits acting for two or more clients in the same matter where there is a conflict, or a significant risk of a conflict, between the interests of those clients. Ben and Jessica have directly opposing interests in the terms of a separation agreement. This is a clear, non-consentable conflict in the same matter, regardless of information barriers or department separation.
Option A is incorrect. Informed consent cannot be given to waive a conflict where the clients are acting against each other in the same litigation or transaction (Paragraph 6.2(a)).
Option B is incorrect. While information barriers (Chinese walls) can address conflicts between different matters, they are generally not sufficient to permit acting against an existing client in the same matter.
Option D is incorrect. While loyalty is a factor, the specific, absolute prohibition is found in the rule against acting for conflicting interests in the same matter.
Option E is incorrect. The conflict arises from the nature of the retainer (acting for opposing parties), not from the possession of confidential information from the prospective client.

Question 31 (CONTRACT)
Maya hires Leo, a specialist painter, to restore a valuable antique mural in her home for a fixed price of £20,000. Leo wrongfully repudiates the contract before starting. Maya immediately seeks alternative quotes. The only available specialist, Zoe, quotes £35,000 for the same work. Maya, deciding this is too expensive, postpones the restoration indefinitely. Two years later, the mural’s condition has deteriorated due to ambient humidity, increasing the eventual restoration cost to £50,000. Maya now sues Leo for breach of contract.
What is the key principle limiting Maya’s recoverable damages?
A. Damages are capped at the original contract price.
B. The claimant must take all possible steps to avoid loss.
C. The claimant must act reasonably to mitigate their loss.
D. Damages for delay are not recoverable.
E. The loss must be within the parties’ contemplation.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The fundamental principle is that a claimant must take reasonable steps to mitigate their loss (British Westinghouse v Underground Electric). The test is one of reasonableness, not taking all possible steps. A court will assess whether accepting Zoe’s quote was a reasonable step. The significant increase in cost due to postponement and deterioration may be deemed unreasonable failure to mitigate, limiting recoverable damages to the likely cost at the time of breach.
Option A is incorrect. Damages aim to put the claimant in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed, which can exceed the contract price (e.g., cost of cure).
Option B is incorrect. The duty is to take reasonable steps, not all possible steps. The standard is objective reasonableness.
Option D is incorrect. Damages for consequential loss, including increased costs due to delay, can be recoverable if not caused by a failure to mitigate.
Option E is incorrect. Remoteness (contemplation) is a separate limiting principle. The issue here is the claimant's conduct after the breach.
Question 32 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
Aisha is a prisoner who has been denied access to a specific educational course by the prison governor. The initial decision to deny her access was made on 1 January. Aisha has repeatedly requested the governor reconsider, and the governor has issued several letters (the most recent on 1 May) stating that the prison policy remains unchanged and she will not be admitted to the course. Aisha files for judicial review on 20 May, challenging the "continuing refusal" to admit her.
How will the court likely treat the time limit for Aisha's challenge?
A.Aisha is in time because the governor's letter on 1 May constitutes a fresh decision, and the 3-month clock started again. 
B. Aisha is out of time because the grounds first arose on 1 January and subsequent refusals to change a policy do not usually restart the clock. 
C. Aisha is in time because the refusal to provide education is a continuing breach of her rights that occurs every day she is denied the course. 
D. Aisha is out of time because prisoners must file all legal challenges within 28 days of a decision. 
E.Aisha is in time because she was required to exhaust all internal prison grievance procedures before filing, which paused the clock.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Courts are wary of claimants trying to "restart" the 3-month clock by asking a public body to reconsider an old decision. Generally, the time limit runs from the original decision (1 January). If the subsequent letters (like the one on 1 May) are merely restating the original position and not based on a fresh assessment of new facts, they do not create new grounds for challenge (R v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, ex p Greenpeace). 
Option C is incorrect. While "continuing acts" exist in some areas of law, in judicial review, the court typically looks for the specific "trigger" decision. 
Option E is incorrect. While you should use alternative remedies, doing so does not automatically stop the JR clock.

Question 33 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
A local council grants planning permission for a large housing development. The applicable planning policy states that permission must be refused if the development would increase traffic on nearby Oak Lane above 500 vehicles per day. The council’s officer report, considered by the planning committee, concludes the development will add 495 vehicles. This figure is based on a traffic survey with a known margin of error of +/- 10%. A resident, Hannah, applies for judicial review.
Which ground of review is most clearly engaged by this factual scenario?
A. Unfairness
B. Irrationality (Wednesbury unreasonableness)
C. Procedural Impropriety
D. Illegality
E. Fettering of Discretion
The correct option is D.
Explanation
Option D is correct. A material mistake of fact, especially one which is established, undisputed, and fundamental to the decision, can be a ground for judicial review, often treated as a species of illegality (E v Secretary of State for the Home Department). Here, the officer’s conclusion of 495 vehicles ignores the survey’s margin of error, which could place the figure over the 500 threshold. This is a mistake as to an established, objective fact that was material to the decision.
Option B is incorrect. Irrationality is a very high threshold (so unreasonable no reasonable authority would do it). A mistake of fact is a distinct, and often easier to establish, ground.
Option C is incorrect. The committee considered the report; the alleged failure is in the report’s accuracy, not the procedure of consideration.
Option E is incorrect. There is no indication the policy was applied with rigid inflexibility; the problem is the flawed data input into the policy application.
Question 34 (BUSINESS LAW)
Joshua and Caleb operate a car valeting business from a unit they rent jointly. They split the weekly profits 60/40. They have no written agreement. They use the trading name “Sparkle & Shine” but are not registered as a partnership. When ordering cleaning supplies, Joshua signs invoices in his own name. A supplier, having unsuccessfully sought payment, claims both Joshua and Caleb are jointly liable for the debt.
Under the Partnership Act 1890, are they in partnership?
A. No, because there is no written partnership agreement.
B. Yes, because they share profits, which is conclusive evidence of partnership.
C. No, because they are not registered and do not use a common business name.
D. Yes, if the true agreement, judged by all the facts, is to carry on business in common with a view of profit.
E. No, because Joshua alone contracted with the supplier.
The correct option is D.
Explanation
Option D is correct. Section 1 of the Partnership Act 1890 defines partnership as “the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit.” The sharing of profits (s.2(3)) is prima facie evidence of partnership, but not conclusive. The court will look at all the facts, joint operation, profit-sharing, joint premises, to determine the true intent. The lack of formalities is irrelevant to the existence of a partnership at common law.
Option A is incorrect. A partnership can be formed orally or by conduct; no written agreement is required.
Option B is incorrect. Profit-sharing is strong evidence but not conclusive; it can be rebutted (e.g., if it was merely a wage).
Option C is incorrect. Registration is not required to form a general partnership. A business name is also not a legal requirement for the partnership relation to exist.
Option E is incorrect. In a partnership, each partner is an agent of the firm and the other partners for the purpose of the business (s.5). A supplier can hold all partners liable for debts incurred in the course of business.
Question 35 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
The Home Secretary makes a decision to deport Farid, a foreign national, to Country X due to his serious criminal convictions. Farid claims that if returned, he will be tortured by the authorities in Country X because of his political opinions, and he provides recent evidence from Amnesty International documenting the systematic use of torture against dissidents there. He seeks to challenge the deportation decision under the Human Rights Act 1998, arguing it violates his Convention rights.
Which Convention Right in Schedule 1 to the HRA 1998 provides the strongest and most absolute barrier to his deportation, and what is the correct legal test?
A. Article 5 
B. Article 3 
C. Article 8 
D. Article 6 
E. Article 14 
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. Article 3 of Schedule 1, ECHR, is an absolute right. The test established in Soering v UK and Chahal v UK is that deporting an individual to a country where there are "substantial grounds for believing" they would face a "real risk" of treatment contrary to Article 3 (torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment) is prohibited, regardless of the individual's conduct. The public interest in deportation cannot be balanced against this absolute right. This is the strongest legal barrier.
Option A is incorrect. Article 5 concerns lawful detention, not deportation risks abroad.
Option C is incorrect. While Article 8 may be engaged, it is a qualified right where proportionality and the public interest are balanced. It is not absolute and is therefore a weaker barrier than Article 3 in this context.
Option D is incorrect. Article 6 concerns the fairness of proceedings within the UK, not the risks awaiting an individual in another country.
Option E is incorrect. While discrimination could be a ground, it must be linked to the enjoyment of another Convention right and does not provide the absolute protection against torture that Article 3 does.


Question 36 (CONTRACT)

Chloe emails Ethan on Monday morning, formally offering to sell her vintage sports car for £25,000. Her email states, "This offer will remain open for your acceptance until 5:00 PM this Friday." On Wednesday, Chloe receives a more attractive offer from another buyer. She immediately prints and posts a signed letter of revocation to Ethan's registered home address, and she also sends him a text message that reads, "Need to talk about the car." The text is delivered but Ethan, who is on a remote camping trip with poor signal, does not see it until Friday evening. 

The posted letter arrives at Ethan's house on Thursday morning, where his housemate signs for it. Unaware of these communications, Ethan posts a formal letter of acceptance at his local post office at 4:00 PM on Wednesday, immediately after deciding to buy. This acceptance letter arrives at Chloe's address on Saturday morning.

When, if at all, was a binding contract formed?
A. On Wednesday at 4:00 PM when Ethan posted his acceptance.
B. On Thursday morning when the revocation letter was delivered.
C. On Friday at 5:00 PM when the offer's deadline passed.
D. On Saturday when Chloe received the acceptance.
E. No contract was formed, as revocation was communicated.

The correct option is A.

Explanation: The postal rule applies where post is a reasonable, anticipated method of acceptance. Chloe's offer did not stipulate a required method, making post reasonable. Acceptance was complete upon posting (Wednesday, 4:00 PM) as per Adams v Lindsell. Revocation must be communicated before acceptance is posted. The revocation letter, though posted earlier, was not communicated (i.e., received and its contents made known) until Thursday morning, which was after the acceptance had been effectively dispatched. The ambiguous text message did not constitute clear communication of revocation. Therefore, a binding contract was formed at the moment of posting the acceptance. Therefore, Options B, C, D and E are incorrect.


Question 37 (TORTS) 
Sophia owns a large, partially abandoned warehouse. The main front yard is openly used as a public shortcut, which Sophia tolerates. A clearly padlocked rear yard contains dangerous, crumbling machinery and is marked with multiple "DANGER – NO TRESPASSING" signs. 

Ben, a local delivery rider looking for a faster route, scales the rear fence, ignoring the signs, to cross the property. While crossing the rear yard, he trips over a hidden cable and is seriously injured by falling machinery. He claims Sophia breached the common duty of care owed under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957. Sophia argues he was a trespasser to whom only the more limited duty under the 1984 Act applied.

What is the decisive factor in determining the duty owed to Ben?

A. Whether the occupier had taken reasonable steps to discourage entry.
B. Whether the injured party had any implied permission to be where they were.
C. Whether the danger was a natural feature of the land or an artificial object.
D. Whether the occupier was aware of the specific risk that caused the injury.
E. Whether the claimant entered the premises for a lawful purpose.

The correct option is B.

Explanation: 
Option B is correct . The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 applies to 'visitors' (those with express or implied permission). The OLA 1984 applies to non-visitors (trespassers). Permission can vary across different parts of premises. While Sophia tolerated use of the front yard (creating implied permission there), the rear yard was expressly prohibited with clear signs and a physical barrier (locked fence). Ben had no permission, express or implied, to be in the rear yard, making him a trespasser in that specific area. The decisive factor is whether he had permission to be in the particular place where the injury occurred, not his overall purpose or Sophia's general knowledge of risks. Therefore, options A, C, D and E are incorrect

Question 38 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
Parliament passes the "National Security (Temporary Exclusion) Act." Under this Act, the Secretary of State can impose a Temporary Exclusion Order (TEO) on a British citizen suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activity abroad. The TEO prohibits the individual from returning to the UK for two years, during which time they cannot have any physical contact with their spouse and young children who reside in the UK. The individual claims the TEO breaches their Convention rights.
Which Convention Right from Schedule 1 is most directly engaged, and what will be the central legal question for the court?
A. Article 2 
B. Article 5 
C. Article 8 
D. Article 11
E. Article 1 of Protocol 1 (Protection of Property). 
The correct option is C.
Explanation:
Option C is correct. The core interference described is the forced separation from a spouse and children, which directly engages Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life). Article 8 is a qualified right. The court's task will be to assess whether the interference: 1) is "in accordance with the law"; 2) pursues a legitimate aim (here, national security); and 3) is "necessary in a democratic society" i.e., proportionate. The state will have a wide margin of appreciation, but the court must still conduct a rigorous proportionality assessment.
Option A is incorrect. While safety abroad may be a concern, it is not the primary legal issue framed by the forced family separation.
Option B is incorrect. An exclusion order preventing entry to the UK does not, in itself, constitute a "deprivation of liberty" under the autonomous meaning of Article 5.
Option D is incorrect. Article 11 protects freedom of peaceful assembly and association with others, typically in a political or public context. Family relationships are primarily protected under Article 8.
Option E is incorrect. While exclusion from one's home may be relevant, the primary and most direct engagement here is with family life, not property rights.

Question 39 (LEGAL SERVICES)
A firm of solicitors is instructed by Mr. Micheal , a prospective client who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. Mr. Micheal wishes to discuss bringing a claim against a local restaurant for disability discrimination. He contacts the firm to arrange a face-to-face meeting at their offices. The firm's premises are in a listed building with a single step at the front entrance and no lift to the first-floor meeting rooms.
 The receptionist, unsure what to do, explains the physical access limitations and suggests a telephone meeting instead. Mr. Micheal is unhappy, feeling this is inadequate for a sensitive initial consultation.
Under the Equality Act 2010, what is the primary legal obligation of the solicitors' firm in this situation?
A. The firm has no obligation to alter its premises, as the building's listed status provides a complete defence.
B. The firm must make reasonable adjustments which could include providing the meeting in an accessible alternative location.
C. The firm has complied by offering a telephone call, as this is a reasonable alternative method of service.
D. The firm is only obligated to make adjustments if Mr. Kapoor formally becomes a client.
E. The duty not to discriminate applies only to the firm's employees, not to its clients.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. Under Part 3 of the Equality Act 2010, a service provider (including a firm of solicitors) owes a duty to make "reasonable adjustments" for disabled persons where a "provision, criterion or practice" (PCP) puts them at a substantial disadvantage. The PCP here is requiring clients to attend meetings in inaccessible rooms. The duty is anticipatory and owed to prospective clients. Reasonable adjustments could include holding the meeting in a ground-floor room, at an accessible alternative venue, or via video conference. Listed building status is a factor in determining what is "reasonable" but does not provide an automatic defence. A mere telephone call may not be a sufficient adjustment for an initial solicitor-client consultation requiring trust and the review of documents. Therefore, options A, C, D and E are incorrect.

Question 40 (LEGAL SERVICES)
Maya, a junior solicitor at a large firm, raises a formal internal grievance alleging that the firm’s flexible working policy indirectly discriminates against female solicitors with childcare responsibilities. Her grievance is investigated and ultimately not upheld. Shortly afterwards, Maya applies for a promotion to a senior associate role for which she is objectively well-qualified. The partnership panel, which includes the partner who conducted the grievance investigation, rejects her application. 
The feedback states her "recent activities have demonstrated a tendency to focus on internal conflicts rather than on collegiate teamwork, which is a key requirement for this role." Maya is subsequently excluded from important client meetings and her supervision becomes overly critical. She believes she is being punished for bringing the grievance.
Which of the following is the most accurate analysis of Maya’s potential claim under the Equality Act 2010?
A. This is direct sex discrimination
B. This is harassment related to sex
C. This is victimisation 
D. This is a failure to make reasonable adjustments, as the firm has not accommodated her childcare needs.
E. The firm’s actions are justified as a proportionate means of maintaining a cohesive working environment.
The correct option is C.
Explanation:
Option C is correct. Victimisation under s.27 of the Equality Act 2010 occurs when a person (A) subjects another (B) to a detriment because B has done a ‘protected act’ (e.g., brought proceedings or made an allegation under the Act). Maya’s grievance about a discriminatory policy is a clear protected act. The rejection of her promotion, coupled with the feedback directly referencing her grievance and the subsequent exclusion and criticism, constitute detrimental treatment that appears to be because of her protected act. This is the classic structure of a victimisation claim.
Option A is incorrect. While the original grievance was about indirect sex discrimination, the treatment she is now complaining about is not because she is a woman or a parent, but because she complained about discrimination. This shifts the claim from direct discrimination to victimisation.
Option B is incorrect. Harassment under s.26 requires unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic (e.g., sex) that violates dignity or creates a hostile environment. The detrimental treatment here is linked to her actions (the grievance), not her sex itself.
Option D is incorrect. A failure to make reasonable adjustments arises from disability, not from making a complaint. There is no suggestion Maya is disabled.
Option E is incorrect. While a firm can take action to maintain cohesion, doing so in direct response to an employee exercising their statutory right to complain about discrimination is unlikely to be a lawful, proportionate justification for victimisation.

Question 41 (CONTRACT LAW)

Liam is in advanced negotiations to purchase a boutique hotel, "The Riverside Retreat," from its owner, Noah. During a formal meeting, Noah presents a detailed summary prepared by his accountant stating, "The hotel's annual net profit, before any owner's salary, is a reliable £95,000." This figure is crucial to Liam's business plan and bank financing. Relying on this representation, Liam signs the sale contract and completes the purchase for £750,000. 

Six months later, Liam's new accountant discovers that the £95,000 figure was calculated after adding back a non-recurring government pandemic grant of £30,000 and before deducting Noah's own substantial, undisclosed management fee. The true, sustainable net profit was closer to £50,000. Liam seeks to rescind the contract. Noah defends the claim, arguing Liam was a sophisticated buyer who had the opportunity to conduct full due diligence and request the underlying management accounts before committing.

What is the pivotal legal issue that will determine Liam's right to rescind the contract for misrepresentation?

A. Whether the statement was one of future opinion rather than present fact.
B. Whether Liam had a reasonable opportunity to discover the truth through due diligence.
C. Whether Noah's representation was made fraudulently, rather than negligently.
D. Whether it is still possible to restore both parties to their pre-contract positions.
E. Whether Noah's false statement actually induced Liam to enter the contract.

Explanation

Option E is correct. The foundational requirement for rescission for misrepresentation is that the false statement induced the claimant to enter the contract. The test is whether the representation was a material reason that significantly influenced the claimant's decision (Edgington v Fitzmaurice). It need not be the sole reason. The court will assess whether a reasonable person in Liam's position would have been influenced, and whether Liam himself was in fact influenced. The availability of due diligence (Option B) does not automatically negate inducement; it is merely a factor the court may consider in assessing whether Liam actually relied on the statement. The primary legal inquiry focuses squarely on the causal link between the untrue statement and the decision to contract.

Option A is incorrect. The statement about historic net profit, presented as a figure from accounts, is a statement of present fact, not a mere opinion or future prediction.
Option B is incorrect. While the opportunity to verify may be evidential, it is not a bar to rescission; the key question remains whether the statement was relied upon.
Option C is incorrect. Fraudulent intent enhances the claim but is not necessary for rescission; negligent or innocent misrepresentation can also found the remedy, though different rules on damages apply.
Option D is incorrect. While restitutio in integrum is a bar to rescission, the question here focuses on the initial right to rescind, for which inducement is the key.


Question 42 (TORTS)

Mason directs a busy parcel sorting depot where Natalie operates powered pallet trucks shifting heavy crates across concrete floors under tight turnaround schedules. He approves her initial operator licence but bypasses recommended advanced modules on weight distribution and ramp negotiation to minimise downtime costs despite equipment manuals highlighting risks. Natalie loads a pallet exceeding safe limits to meet quotas, causing the truck to topple on a slight incline and crush her ankle, necessitating pins, grafts, and extended physiotherapy. She confronts reduced mobility threatening her role. Mason references her tenure as mitigating training needs. Internal logs reveal lapsed risk assessments and Natalie alleges systemic safety deficits.  
Is Mason liable to Natalie for her workplace injury?  
A. No, because his only obligation is to purchase comprehensive accident coverage.  
B. Yes, due to a non-delegable duty ensuring safe working systems.  
C. No, as duty is satisfied by bare statutory compliance.  
D. No, since duty is fully transferable to line supervisors.  
E. No, as duty is extinguished by Natalie's overloading choice.  
The correct option is B  
Explanation  
Option B is correct because employers hold a personal, non-delegable duty to furnish safe plant, competent colleagues, and proper systems of work, per Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co v English, extending to adequate training tailored to tasks. Mason's omission of specialised instruction breaches this, rendering the depot unsafe irrespective of delegation or employee experience. This established duty prioritises worker protection structurally.  
Option A is incorrect because insurance facilitates compensation, not the duty itself. The common law mandates proactive safety.  
Option C is incorrect because the duty surpasses minimum regulations. Compliant employers may still be in breach.  
Option D is incorrect because non-delegable prevents responsibility shift. The employer remains accountable.  
Option E is incorrect because contributory negligence leads to apportionment of damages rather than complete negation of the employer's duty. The systemic safety failure remains the primary basis for liability.

Question 43 (BUSINESS LAW)

"Vertex Innovations Ltd" is a private company with a share capital structure defined in its articles. The articles state that the company's authorised share capital is 150,000 ordinary £1 shares. To date, 100,000 shares have been issued. The articles are silent on which corporate body has the power to allot new shares. The board of directors, seeking to raise growth capital from a venture capital firm, passes a resolution at a board meeting to allot 30,000 new shares to the investor.
Based on the default provisions of the Companies Act 2006, is the board's resolution sufficient to lawfully allot these shares?

A.No, the power to allot must be conferred by the company's articles or a special resolution of the members.
B. Yes, because the allotment remains within the company's authorised share capital limit.
C. No, the power to allot must be conferred by the company's articles or an ordinary resolution of the members.
D. No, an ordinary resolution of the members is always required for any allotment of shares.
E. Yes, the Model Articles provide directors with default authority to allot shares.

Explanation
Option C is correct. Section 549 of the Companies Act 2006 is a default provision that applies when a company's articles are silent. It states that "the directors of a company must not exercise any power of the company to allot shares" unless they are authorised to do so by the company's articles or by an ordinary resolution of the members (shareholders). The existence of unissued authorised capital is a separate prerequisite but does not itself confer authority on the directors to allot. Therefore, with silent articles, the directors lack the power unless shareholders pass an ordinary resolution granting it. This ensures that the fundamental dilution of existing ownership is subject to shareholder approval unless the articles explicitly delegate that power. Therefore, Option A is incorrect. 
Option B is incorrect. Staying within the authorised capital is necessary but not sufficient; authority to allot is a separate legal requirement.
Option D is incorrect. It is too absolute; authority can be pre-conferred by the articles, avoiding the need for a resolution for each allotment.
Option E is incorrect. The Model Articles for private companies do not give a default authority to allot; they defer to the statutory regime in the Companies Act 2006.

Question 44 (Dispute resolution)

Jacob entered into a contract with Daniel to purchase a new, high-end commercial oven for his bakery. The contract specified a model with precise temperature controls and a rapid steam-injection function, critical for Jacob's signature sourdough bread. The oven delivered and installed failed to maintain stable temperatures and the steam function was defective, producing inconsistent results and ruining batches of product.
Jacob sued Daniel in the County Court for breach of contract, seeking damages for the cost of the faulty oven, lost profits from spoiled goods, and the cost of a replacement. Jacob, the claimant lost at trial in the County Court. Jacob appeals to a Circuit Judge in the County Court, who hears the appeal and dismisses it. Dissatisfied, Jacob now seeks to appeal again, this time to the Court of Appeal (Civil Division). He must apply to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal.

What is the specific statutory test the Court of Appeal must apply when considering permission for this second appeal?

A. The appeal must have a real prospect of success.
B. The appeal must raise an important point of principle or practice.
C. The appeal must show the lower court's decision was wrong or unjust due to serious procedural irregularity.
D. There must be a compelling reason for the Court of Appeal to hear it.
E. The appeal must be justified by the overriding objective.

Explanation
Option D is correct. This is governed by CPR 52.7. For a second appeal (an appeal from a decision of a County Court or High Court that was itself made on appeal), the threshold is significantly higher than for a first appeal. The Court of Appeal will not give permission unless it considers that the appeal would raise "an important point of principle or practice" or there is "some other compelling reason for the Court of Appeal to hear it." This strict test is designed to limit second appeals to cases of wider significance or where there is a substantial injustice that only the Court of Appeal can address, preventing the Court of Appeal from being used merely as a further rehearing of the facts.
Option A is incorrect. This is the test for permission to appeal a first-instance decision (CPR 52.6), which is a lower threshold.
Option B is incorrect. While raising an important point is one limb of the test, it is not the only one; the alternative is "some other compelling reason."
Option C is incorrect. This describes potential grounds for appealing the merits of a decision, not the test for permission to bring a second appeal.
Option E is incorrect. The overriding objective is a general principle, but the specific test for second appeal permission is the stringent one in CPR 52.7.


Question 45 (Legal services)
Marcus is charged with "Theft from a Shop" (an either-way offence) in the Magistrates' Court. He has no previous convictions and works as a delivery driver. He is worried that a conviction will lead to him losing his job because his employer has a zero-tolerance policy for dishonesty. He applies for a Representation Order.
Which of the following best describes the Interests of Justice test for Marcus?
A.Marcus automatically passes the test because the charge involves an either-way offence.
B. Marcus is likely to pass the test  because he faces a likely loss of his livelihood. 
C. Marcus will fail the test because theft is not a serious offence like robbery or murder. 
D.The test is irrelevant because Marcus is employed; only unemployed defendants can pass the Interests of Justice test. 
E. Marcus will fail because the Interests of Justice test only considers the likelihood of a prison sentence .
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. For criminal cases in the Magistrates' Court, the court applies the Widgery Criteria to see if it is in the interests of justice to grant aid. One of these criteria is the "likely loss of livelihood" resulting from a conviction.
 Option A is incorrect. There is no "automatic" pass for either-way offences in the Magistrates' Court (though Crown Court trials do automatically satisfy the merits test). Option E is incorrect. While loss of liberty is a primary factor, it is not the only factor.

Question 46 (Dispute resolution)
GlobalTech Inc, a US company, is in a dispute with a UK software firm over a highly technical patent licensing agreement. The contract contains a clause stating that any disputes must be resolved by arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA). GlobalTech prefers this method over litigation because they wish to keep the technical details of their source code out of the public domain.
Which characteristic of arbitration makes it the most appropriate mechanism for GlobalTech in this scenario?
A.Arbitration is a public process, which will ensure the decision is recorded in the law reports.
B. The parties can appoint an arbitrator with specific technical expertise and the proceedings are private and confidential. 
C.Arbitration is entirely non-binding, allowing GlobalTech to walk away if they do not like the outcome. 
D.The court will automatically stay any arbitration proceedings if the matter is too technical for a lay arbitrator. 
E. An arbitral award is easier to appeal than a court judgment if the arbitrator makes an error of law.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Two "killer" characteristics of arbitration are expertise and confidentiality. Unlike judges (who are legal generalists), arbitrators can be chosen for their niche technical knowledge. Furthermore, unlike the "open justice" principle in litigation, arbitration is a private and confidential process, protecting trade secrets. Option A is incorrect. Arbitration is private; litigation is public. 
Option C is incorrect. Arbitration results in an "award" which is final and legally binding. 
Option E is incorrect. One of the main downsides (or features) of arbitration is finality; there are very limited grounds to appeal an award under the Arbitration Act 1996.
Question 47 (Dispute resolution)

On 10th October 2021, Mr. Lee was involved in a minor road traffic accident. He felt a slight neck twinge but thought nothing of it and did not seek medical attention. On 1st March 2023, after months of worsening pain, he was diagnosed with a serious spinal disc injury that a specialist directly attributed to the 2021 accident. Mr. Lee wishes to bring a claim in negligence against the other driver. He contacts a solicitor on 15th April 2024.
In relation to the primary limitation period for his personal injury claim, which of the following is correct?
A. Time expired on 10th October 2023 (three years from the accident date), so the claim is now statute-barred.
B. Time expires on 1st March 2026 (three years from the date of knowledge of the significant injury), so the claim is still in time.
C. Time expires on 15th April 2027 (three years from the date of first consulting a solicitor), so the claim is still in time.
D. The court has a complete discretion to extend the limitation period if it would be fair to do so, so he can always proceed.
E. Because the injury was latent, the 15-year long-stop limitation period under the Latent Damage Act 1986 applies.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. Under Section 11 of the Limitation Act 1980, the primary limitation period for personal injury is three years from either the date of the accident or the "date of knowledge" of the injured person, whichever is later. The "date of knowledge" is defined in Section 14 and includes knowledge that the injury was significant and attributable to the alleged negligence. Mr. Lee’s date of knowledge was 1st March 2023, when he received the diagnosis linking the significant injury to the accident. Therefore, the limitation period expires on 1st March 2026.
Option A is incorrect as it ignores the "date of knowledge" provisions.
Option C is incorrect; the date of instructing a solicitor is not a relevant date under the Act.
Option D is incorrect; the court’s discretion under Section 33 to disapply the time limit is not complete and is exercised only in exceptional circumstances after considering specific factors. It is not an automatic right.
Option E is incorrect; the Latent Damage Act 1986 applies to negligence not involving personal injury (e.g., defective buildings). Personal injury has its own specific regime under Sections 11-14.

Question 48 (BUSINESS LAW)

A partnership comprising three equal partners makes a tax-adjusted loss of £60,000 in the tax year. One of the partners, Clara, has no other source of income.
How can Clara utilise her share of the partnership loss?
A. She can carry the loss forward against her future share of partnership profits only.
B. She can offset her £20,000 share of the loss against her other income for the same tax year or the previous tax year.
C. The loss must be allocated to the other partners since she has no income.
D. She can surrender the loss to the partnership to be used against the partnership's future profits.
E. The loss is lost and cannot be used by anyone.
B is the correct option.
Explanation
B is correct. A partner's share of a trading loss can be used under the "sideways loss relief" rules. This allows the loss to be set against the partner's other total income in the same tax year or the previous tax year, generating a tax refund. Clara's share of the loss is £20,000 (£60,000 / 3).
A is incorrect. While carrying forward against future partnership profits is an option, it is not the only one; sideways relief is available.
C is incorrect. Losses are allocated to partners according to the profit-sharing ratio, and each partner can utilise their share individually.
D is incorrect. Partners cannot surrender their share of a loss to the entity or other partners; losses are personal to each partner.
E is incorrect as trading losses are a valuable asset and can be utilised in several ways.
Question 49 (BUSINESS LAW)
In "Precision Engineering Ltd," Daniel (a 40% shareholder and technical director) petitions the court on the grounds of unfair prejudice under s.994 of the Companies Act 2006. He proves that the majority shareholder and managing director, Michael (60%), has excluded him from management, paid himself excessive salaries and bonuses without declaration, and awarded major contracts to a connected company without tender. The relationship is irretrievably broken down. The company remains profitable with good prospects.

Following a finding of unfair prejudice, which of the following remedies is the court most likely to order?

A. An injunction regulating the company's future affairs and reinstating Daniel.
B. An order requiring Michael to sell his shares to Daniel at a fair value.
C. An order requiring the company or Michael to purchase Daniel's shares at a fair value.
D. An order for the company to be wound up on the just and equitable ground.
E. An order for the company to pay equitable compensation (damages) to Daniel.

Explanation

Option C is correct. Where unfair prejudice is found and the relationship between shareholders has broken down, the most common and practical remedy is a share purchase order. Typically, the court orders the wrongdoer (Michael) or the company itself to purchase the petitioner's (Daniel's) shares. This provides a clean exit for the unfairly prejudiced minority at a fair value, often without a minority discount, reflecting the loss of his quasi-partnership expectations. It allows the business, which is viable, to continue. Winding up (Option D) is a draconian last resort for deadlock or where no other remedy is suitable. An injunction (Option A) is ineffective where trust is gone. Compensation (Option E) is rare as a sole remedy and is often factored into the share valuation.
Option A is incorrect. This is generally impractical where trust and confidence between shareholders, the foundation of many private companies, has been destroyed.
Option B is incorrect. It is highly unusual to force the sale of the majority's shares to the minority; the remedy is typically an exit for the prejudiced petitioner.
Option D is incorrect. Winding up is a remedy of last resort under s.122(1)(g) of the Insolvency Act 1986 and would not be ordered where a less drastic alternative (a buy-out) is available and appropriate.
Option E is incorrect. While the court can order compensation, it is more common to reflect any past financial loss in the valuation of the shares to be purchased (e.g., by using a valuation date before the prejudice began).


Question 50 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
Solicitor Noah's firm is instructed by a long-standing business client, Chloe, who is remortgaging her £800,000 London home to release equity for a new business venture. The lender is a mainstream high-street bank with which the firm has a panel appointment. The bank's standard instructions permit the firm to act for both borrower and lender in the transaction, provided no conflict arises. The loan-to-value ratio is 60%.

Before accepting this dual retainer, what is the fundamental requirement that Noah must ensure is satisfied according to the SRA Code of Conduct?

A. He must verify that the loan is on the bank's standard published terms.
B. He must obtain the informed consent of both Chloe and the bank to the arrangement.
C. He must confirm that separate fee earners within the firm will handle each client's work.
D. He must ensure the firm's professional indemnity insurance covers dual representation.
E. He must undertake enhanced anti-money laundering checks on Chloe.

Explanation
Option B is correct. Paragraph 6.2 of the SRA Code of Conduct governs conflicts of interest. Acting for both borrower and lender is a classic situation of a potential client conflict. The Code permits acting where the clients have a substantially common interest (as can be the case in a standard mortgage) only if all the clients have given informed consent. This means clearly explaining the limitations of the service (e.g., that Noah cannot advise the bank on the commercial wisdom of the loan or advise Chloe if her interests conflict with fulfilling the lender's instructions) and the implications, including any confidential information that will not be shared. Obtaining this documented, informed consent from both parties is the cornerstone of the arrangement and a mandatory regulatory requirement.

Option A is incorrect. While verifying terms is part of the work, it is not the fundamental regulatory precondition for accepting the dual retainer.
Option C is incorrect. Information barriers are not typically used or required for standard conveyancing dual representation; the key is informed consent and managing the conflict.
Option D is incorrect. While insurance is necessary, it is a matter for the firm's management, not the specific precondition for accepting these client instructions.
Option E is incorrect. AML checks are mandatory but are a separate regulatory requirement, not the specific rule governing conflicts of interest and dual representation.


Question 51 (LEGAL SERVICES)

A consortium of entrepreneurs, none of whom are lawyers, wishes to establish a new legal service provider, "The Business Boutique Ltd," aiming to offer a streamlined service to startups. Their business plan involves preparing and registering new companies at Companies House for their clients. They intend to hire a recently qualified solicitor to carry out this work. They believe that because they will employ a qualified solicitor, their company will automatically be authorised to provide this service and they can begin trading immediately. They have not yet applied to the SRA for authorisation.

What is the accurate position regarding their plan to provide this service?

A.They are correct; hiring a qualified solicitor automatically authorises the company to provide all legal services, including reserved activities.
B.They can provide general legal advice on company formation but must refer the actual reserved activity of preparing and registering the company to an external authorised firm.
C.The company itself must be specifically authorised by the SRA as a recognised body before it can provide the reserved legal activity of reserved instrument activities
D.They can proceed as planned, but only if the solicitor they hire personally applies for and obtains a practising certificate.
E.They are permitted to provide this service as it is a purely administrative task and does not constitute a reserved legal activity.

C is the correct option.

Explanation

C is the correct option. Under the Legal Services Act 2007, certain activities, including "reserved instrument activities" (which encompasses preparing prescribed forms for the creation of a company and executing them as a deed), are reserved legal activities. A body corporate (a company) must itself be authorised by an approved regulator, like the SRA, to provide such services. This authorisation is separate from the qualification of its employees. The firm must demonstrate that it, its managers, and its owners are suitable and that it has compliant systems in place. Simply employing a solicitor does not grant the corporate entity the right to conduct reserved activities.

A is incorrect. Firm authorisation is a distinct and mandatory process. The SRA assesses the entity's structure, governance, and ownership, not just the qualifications of its staff.

B is incorrect. While they could provide non-reserved advice, the specific act of preparing and registering the company documents is a reserved activity. They cannot undertake this themselves without being an authorised firm.

D is incorrect. The solicitor's practising certificate allows them to do the work, but it does not authorise the company to provide reserved legal activities. The solicitor would also be in breach by carrying out reserved activities for an unauthorised firm.

E is incorrect. The preparation of certain instruments for the creation of a company is explicitly defined as a reserved instrument activity under the Legal Services Act 2007 and is not merely administrative.

Question 52 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)

"Keystone Corporate Law Ltd" is an authorised firm with a good reputation. The SRA commences a routine investigation into the firm's compliance following an anonymous tip-off about its internal governance. During the investigation, the SRA requests access to all board minutes and financial stability reports for the past two years. The managing partner of Keystone, believing the request to be a fishing expedition and an overreach, instructs the firm to provide only heavily redacted documents, omitting all discussions about client profitability and strategic business planning, arguing this information is commercially sensitive and irrelevant to regulatory compliance.

What is the likely regulatory outcome of the firm's decision?

:
A.The SRA will accept the redactions as the firm has a right to protect its commercial confidentiality from the regulator.
B.The firm is entitled to challenge the SRA's request through a formal judicial review process before being compelled to provide the documents.
C.The firm is in breach of its regulatory obligations to cooperate openly with the SRA, which could itself be a disciplinary matter leading to sanctions.
D.The SRA will accept the redaction because of the firm’s good reputation
E.The SRA's powers are limited, and it must obtain a court order to access any internal management documents beyond basic client account records.

C is the correct option.

Explanation

C is the correct option. A condition of a firm's authorisation is to deal with its regulator in an open, timely, and cooperative manner. The SRA has broad powers to request information to discharge its regulatory functions. While commercial sensitivity is a consideration, it is not a blanket right to withhold information from the regulator. Unilaterally redacting documents requested by the SRA, particularly those relating to governance and financial stability, demonstrates a failure to cooperate. This lack of transparency is a serious matter in its own right and could lead to disciplinary action against the firm and its managers, separate from the original subject of the investigation.

A is incorrect. The SRA is entitled to see unredacted information to properly assess a firm's compliance, including its financial health and management decisions. The firm's duty of cooperation overrides general claims of commercial sensitivity in this context.

B is incorrect. While judicial review is a theoretical last resort, the firm's primary obligation is to comply with the SRA's request. Refusing to cooperate at the outset is a breach of its regulatory duties and is likely to be treated as misconduct, regardless of the eventual outcome of a legal challenge. D is incorrect.
E is incorrect. The SRA's investigative powers are extensive and are not dependent on obtaining a court order for routine monitoring and investigations. The firm's contract with the regulator, through its authorisation, includes a duty to provide information upon request. 



Question 53 ( LEGAL SERVICES)

Mr. and Mrs. Dexter instructed a firm of solicitors, "County Legal Partners," to challenge a decision by their local planning authority to refuse them permission to build a home extension. The solicitor handling the matter failed to file their judicial review claim form within the strict three-month time limit, mistakenly calculating the deadline incorrectly. 

As a result, their claim against the public authority was struck out as being out of time, and they lost their right to challenge what they believed was an unlawful administrative decision. The firm's internal complaints procedure resulted in an apology but no offer of financial redress. Dissatisfied, the Dexter wish to escalate the matter to an independent body that can compel the firm to provide compensation for the solicitor's clear negligence.

Which body is constitutionally established to perform this specific function, and what is the correct sequence of action?

A.They should apply to the High Court for a claim in professional negligence, as this is the only body that can award damages for a solicitor's error.
B.They should report the solicitor to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, which has the power to order compensation for service failures to clients.
C.They must first complete the firm's internal complaints procedure and then, if dissatisfied, they can refer the service complaint to the Legal Ombudsman.
D.They should appeal to the Legal Services Board, as the oversight regulator, to investigate the individual solicitor's misconduct and order a remedy.
E.They should make a complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman, as the original grievance was against a decision of the local planning authority.

C is the correct option.

Explanation

C is the correct option. The Legal Ombudsman (LeO) is the independent body established under the Legal Services Act 2007 to resolve complaints about poor service from legal providers. Its role is distinct from that of a regulator. The correct procedure requires a complainant to first use the firm's internal complaints process. If unresolved after eight weeks, or if the complainant is dissatisfied with the firm's final response, they can then refer the matter to the LeO. The LeO has the power to investigate and order the firm to apologise, correct the mistake, and/or pay compensation of up to £50,000. This provides a vital avenue of redress for individuals challenging the state, ensuring access to justice is not undermined by poor legal representation.

A is incorrect. While a negligence claim is possible, it is a more complex, costly, and lengthy process. The LeO scheme provides a free, more accessible alternative for resolving service complaints, which is precisely its constitutional purpose.

B is incorrect. The SRA's role is to enforce professional conduct rules and protect the public interest through disciplinary action, not to adjudicate on individual service complaints or order compensation for clients. Its focus is on conduct, not consumer redress.

D is incorrect. The Legal Services Board (LSB) is the oversight regulator for frontline regulators like the SRA. It does not handle individual complaints about solicitors or law firms; its role is strategic and systemic.

E is incorrect. The Local Government Ombudsman investigates maladministration by local authorities, not professional negligence by a firm of solicitors. The Davies' complaint is about their legal representative's failure, not the original planning decision.

Question 54 (TORT)

Mr. David Fletcher, a chartered surveyor, was engaged by Mr. & Mrs. Carter to conduct a full structural survey on a Victorian terraced house they were planning to purchase. Mr. Fletcher’s report stated that the property was "structurally sound" and that the roof showed "no signs of significant wear". Relying on this report, the Carters proceeded with the purchase, forgoing a cheaper, more basic survey from another firm. 
Six months after moving in, during a period of heavy snowfall, a large section of the roof timbers, which were extensively rotten, collapsed into the loft, causing significant damage to the first-floor ceiling and ruining a valuable antique bed. An independent surveyor confirmed that the rot was long-standing and would have been obvious to a competent surveyor conducting a diligent inspection. The Carters are now facing substantial repair costs and have sued Mr. Fletcher for the cost of the repairs and the consequent devaluation of their property.

Is Mr Fletcher liable to the Carters?

A. No, Mr. Fletcher is not liable. The Carters' decision to forgo a cheaper survey was their own choice and breaks the chain of causation.
B. No, Mr. Fletcher is not liable. A surveyor's report is an opinion based on a visual inspection.
C. Yes, Mr. Fletcher will be liable if his inspection failed to meet the standard of a reasonably competent surveyor,

D. Yes, Mr. Fletcher will be liable if his inspection failed to meet the standard of a reasonable man.
E. Yes, Mr. Fletcher is liable, but only for the fee the Carters paid for the survey, as this was the total value of the service he was contracted to provide.

C is the correct option.

Explanation

C is the correct option. This correctly identifies the established duty of care between a professional and their client. A surveyor is required to exercise the skill and care of a reasonably competent professional. If Mr. Fletcher's inspection was negligent and failed to identify a defect that should have been found, he is in breach of that duty. The financial losses suffered by the Carters, including repair costs and property devaluation, are a direct and foreseeable consequence of relying on that negligent report to purchase a defective property. Therefore, option D is incorrect.
A is incorrect. The Carters' reliance on the more expensive, comprehensive survey was reasonable and was the very purpose of hiring Mr. Fletcher. Their decision to rely on his professional expertise does not break the chain of causation; it is the foundation of it.
B is incorrect. While a survey is not an absolute warranty, it is not merely an uninformed opinion. It is a professional assessment that must be conducted with reasonable skill and care. A failure to meet that standard, resulting in a missed major defect, constitutes negligence.
E is incorrect. The duty of care in professional negligence is not limited to a refund of the fee. It extends to all losses that are a foreseeable consequence of the professional's breach of duty, which in this case includes the cost of repairing the defect and the loss in property value.




Question 55 (TORT)

Benjamin Carter, a 58-year-old warehouse operative with over twenty years of experience at "QuickStock Logistics," was instructed by his manager, Mr. Higgins, to clear a blockage from a high-level conveyor system that was causing a significant backlog in orders. The company had a official safe system of work detailed in the employee handbook and in posters around the warehouse. 
This required the use of a specific mobile elevating work platform (MEWP) and a two-person team for this task, one to operate the platform and another to act as a banksman. On this day, the designated MEWP was undergoing its mandatory annual service. Mr. Higgins, under pressure to clear the blockage quickly, told Benjamin to "just use the tall ladder and get it sorted." The ladder was not designed for prolonged work at height and lacked the stability of the MEWP. 
While Benjamin was attempting to dislodge the blockage, the ladder slipped on the polished concrete floor. He fell three metres, suffering a complex fracture to his pelvis and a serious back injury. Benjamin is now pursuing a claim against QuickStock Logistics.

Does QuickStock Logistics owe Benjamin a duty of care?

A. No, the company does not owe a duty. Benjamin, as an experienced employee, voluntarily assumed the risk by agreeing to use the ladder despite knowing the official safety procedure.

B. Yes, the company owes a duty. The manager's instruction to bypass the established safe system of work created an unsafe working environment.
C. No, the company does not owe a duty. The manager acted negligently on his own initiative, and his actions were outside the scope of his employment.
D. Yes, the company owes a duty, but only if it can be proven that the specific ladder was defective or improperly maintained, which caused it to slip.
E. No, the company does not owe a duty. The employee's own clumsiness was the sole cause of the accident.

B is the correct option.

Explanation

B is the correct option. An employer has a non-delegable duty to provide a safe system of work. This duty is personal to the employer and cannot be discharged by simply having a written procedure. The manager, acting as an agent of the company, instructed an employee to bypass this safe system and use unsafe equipment. This direct instruction from a superior created the hazardous situation and constitutes a clear breach of the employer's fundamental duty to its employee, regardless of the pressure to complete the work.

A is incorrect. The defence of volenti (voluntary assumption of risk) is very difficult to establish in an employment context. An employee following a direct instruction from a manager, especially under pressure, is not considered to be voluntarily agreeing to accept the legal risk of injury. The primary duty for safety remains with the employer.

C is incorrect. The manager was acting within the course of his employment when he gave a work-related instruction to an employee. The company is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed in the course of their employment, which includes a manager negligently instructing a subordinate.

D is incorrect. This focuses too narrowly on a potential defect in the ladder. The primary breach was the systemic failure to provide and enforce a safe system of work. The company's liability arises from instructing an employee to use an inappropriate and unsafe method for the task, not solely from the condition of the ladder itself.

E is incorrect. The employer's duty extends beyond providing a physically safe premises. It includes a duty to devise and enforce a safe system for performing hazardous tasks. The accident was caused by the unsafe system of using a ladder for a task requiring a stable platform, not merely by the floor's condition or the employee's actions.

Question 56 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Daniel was involved in a car accident on 10 September 2021. He suffered minor whiplash but didn't think it was serious enough to sue. In December 2023, his neck pain became debilitating. On 14 January 2024, a specialist confirmed that the 2021 accident had caused a significant spinal disc protrusion that would require surgery. Daniel wants to issue a claim for personal injury.
What is the latest date by which Daniel must issue his claim?
A.10 September 2024 (3 years from the accident). 
B. 14 January 2027 (3 years from the date of the specialist's report). 
C. 10 September 2027 (6 years from the accident). 
D.14 January 2025 (1 year from the specialist's report). 
E.31 December 2026 (3 years from when the pain became debilitating).
The correct option is A.
Explanation
Option A is correct. Under s.11 of the Limitation Act 1980, the 3-year limitation period for personal injury runs from the date of the accident OR the "date of knowledge" of the injury, whichever is later.
In this scenario, Daniel's "knowledge" is assessed objectively. He knew he was injured and knew the cause (the accident) on 10 September 2021. The fact that the injury later turned out to be more severe than he initially thought does not usually "reset" the clock for the purposes of the statutory deadline.
Option B is incorrect because the "date of knowledge" extension is generally reserved for latent injuries (like asbestos-related illnesses) where the claimant could not have known they were injured at the time.
Option C is incorrect as 6 years is the period for contract/tort (non-PI), not personal injury.
Option D and E reflect incorrect timeframes and starting points.


Question 57 (BUSINESS LAW)
Maria is the sole shareholder and director of "Bespoke Furniture Ltd." She takes out a £50,000 business loan from a bank in the company's name to purchase a new industrial lathe. The company buys the lathe, but six months later, a major client goes bankrupt, leaving Bespoke Furniture Ltd. unable to pay its debts, including the bank loan. 

The company has no other significant assets. The bank is now seeking repayment. Maria used the company's funds to pay herself a modest market-rate salary throughout, and there is no suggestion she acted dishonestly. The company's accounts were properly maintained, and the loan was used exclusively for the intended business purpose. 

Which of the following statements best describes the legal position regarding Maria's personal liability for the company's debt to the bank?

a) Maria is personally liable for the entire £50,000 debt because she is the sole decision-maker and the company is essentially her "alter ego."
b) Maria's liability is limited to the amount she that is reasonable and fair to pay.
c) Maria is personally liable because she signed the loan agreement on behalf of the company as its director.
d) The bank can only seek repayment from the assets of Bespoke Furniture Ltd., and Maria's personal assets are protected.
e) Maria is only personally liable if the bank can prove she acted fraudulently in obtaining the loan.

D is the correct option 
Explanation
D is the correct option. This option most accurately and comprehensively states the legal position. It correctly identifies that the company, as a separate legal person, is the debtor. It then explicitly confirms that the principle of limited liability protects Maria's personal assets from the company's debts. This directly applies the foundational principles established in the chapter. The company's failure is a commercial risk the bank took when lending to a limited company.
A is incorrect. It misapplies the concept of "lifting the corporate veil." The mere fact that Maria is the sole shareholder and director does not, by itself, justify ignoring the company's separate legal personality. The principle from Salomon v Salomon & Co Ltd establishes that a company is a distinct legal person, even if it is controlled by one individual. 
B is incorrect. The principle of limited liability protects Maria's personal assets from the company's debts
C is incorrect. When a director signs a contract "for and on behalf of" the company, they are acting as an agent. The resulting contract is with the company, not the director personally. The director's signature binds the company, not themselves, assuming they had the authority to sign, which she did as the director.
E is incorrect. While fraudulent trading is a statutory exception to limited liability, the scenario explicitly states there was no dishonesty. 

Question 58 (BUSINESS LAW)

David and Chloe are directors of "EcoBuild Ltd.," a construction company. They know the company is insolvent and has no realistic prospect of paying its existing suppliers. Despite this, they persuade a new supplier, "Quality Materials Ltd.," to deliver £80,000 worth of timber on credit by providing falsified bank statements showing a healthy cash balance. 

David and Chloe immediately sell the timber for cash at a discount to a competitor and use the money to pay themselves large "bonuses," leaving the company with no assets to fulfil its obligations. EcoBuild Ltd. is then placed into liquidation, unable to pay Quality Materials Ltd. or its other creditors. The liquidator discovers the falsified documents and the diversion of funds. 

Which of the following statements accurately describes the potential personal liability of David and Chloe?
a)David and Chloe have no personal liability because the debt was incurred by EcoBuild Ltd., the separate legal entity.
b) David and Chloe may be personally liable to make a contribution to EcoBuild Ltd.'s assets for fraudulent trading.
c) David and Chloe are only liable if they failed to register the company correctly at Companies House.
d) The supplier, Quality Materials Ltd., can only sue EcoBuild Ltd. and has no direct claim against David and Chloe personally.
e) David and Chloe are only liable for the debt if they personally guaranteed the company's obligations to Quality Materials Ltd.

B is the correct option.

Explanation
B is the correct option. This scenario is a classic example of fraudulent trading under s.213 of the Insolvency Act 1986. The test requires that business has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors. David and Chloe knowingly incurred a debt with no intention of paying it, using deception (falsified statements) with the sole purpose of extracting cash for themselves. A court can declare them personally liable to contribute to the company's assets as a result, making funds available for all creditors.

A is incorrect. This option ignores the statutory exception for fraudulent trading. The separate legal personality of the company is not an absolute shield for dishonest conduct. The actions of David and Chloe were blatantly dishonest, designed to personally enrich themselves at the creditor's expense.
C is incorrect. Registration of the company is a separate formality. The fraudulent conduct after incorporation is the source of liability here, not any defect in the initial formation. Their liability arises from their actions, not a technicality in the company's creation.
D is incorrect. While the primary claim in contract is against the company, s.213 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides a specific mechanism for the liquidator to pursue the directors personally. The funds recovered would then form part of the company's assets available for distribution to all creditors, including Quality Materials Ltd.
E is incorrect. A personal guarantee would create a separate contractual liability. However, the facts here establish a statutory liability for fraudulent trading that exists independently of any guarantee. Their liability is a consequence of their fraud, not a breach of a separate promise.

Question 59 (BUSINESS LAW)

Tom is a director of "Tech Solutions Ltd." At a board meeting in January, the company's accountant presents financial forecasts showing that without a significant cash injection, the company will be unable to pay its debts as they fall due from March onwards. The directors, including Tom, decide to continue trading, hoping a new product launch will save the company. 

They do not seek professional advice on the company's viability. In April, with the situation worsening, they take out a new £25,000 loan from a different lender to fund a last-ditch marketing campaign, increasing the total liabilities. The product fails to gain traction, and the company enters insolvent liquidation in May, with debts of £200,000. The liquidator believes the directors should have acted earlier to minimise creditor losses. 

When did Tom's potential liability for wrongful trading most likely begin?

a) Tom is not liable because he was acting in the genuine hope of saving the company.
b) Tom's liability began in May, when the company formally entered liquidation.
c) Tom's liability began in January, when he ought to have concluded there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation.
d) Tom is only liable for the new £25,000 debt incurred in April, not the older debts.
e) Tom's liability began when he first became a director of the company.

C is the correct option 

Explanation
C is the correct option. This correctly applies the test for wrongful trading. The dire financial forecasts presented in January likely represent the point at which a reasonably diligent director should have realized the company was doomed. Continuing to trade and, crucially, incurring new debt after this point without taking every step to minimise loss to creditors is the conduct that triggers potential liability. The new loan in April worsened the position of the new lender and other creditors.
A is incorrect. A genuine but unreasonable hope is not a defence to wrongful trading. The test under s.214 of the Insolvency Act 1986 is objective: what a reasonably diligent person with the director's knowledge and experience ought to have concluded. The failure to seek independent advice on the bleak forecasts in January would weigh against him.
B is incorrect. The point of liability is not the date of liquidation itself, but the point in time before liquidation when the director knew or should have concluded that insolvent liquidation was inevitable. Liquidation is the event that allows the liquidator to bring the claim, not the trigger for the wrongful conduct.
D is incorrect. While the new debt is strong evidence of worsening the creditors' position, a wrongful trading order can require a contribution to the company's assets generally, not just for a specific debt. The court looks at the overall loss to creditors from the point of "no reasonable prospect."
E is incorrect. Liability is not triggered by the appointment itself, but by the director's actions and omissions once the company is in financial distress. A director is not liable for trading that occurs while the company is solvent and viable.

Question 60 (BUSINESS LAW)

"Swift Deliveries Ltd," a private courier company, has consistently and knowingly failed to meet its statutory filing obligations over the past two consecutive years. Its annual accounts have been filed late on multiple occasions, resulting in the accumulation of significant automatic financial penalties from Companies House. Furthermore, the company's most recent confirmation statement is now also significantly overdue by several months, compounding its compliance failures. The company's sole director, Mr. Nathan Jones, has personally received and subsequently ignored repeated formal reminders and escalating warning notices sent by Companies House. Mr. Jones has consistently prioritised immediate day-to-day operational pressures over these legal responsibilities. The company is now facing severe and worsening cash flow difficulties, partly exacerbated by the unpaid fines. A key supplier, upon discovering the company's publicly documented and poor compliance history via a standard register search, has formally refused to extend any further credit for essential fuel and vehicle maintenance. This supplier is now threatening to petition for the company's compulsory liquidation.

Beyond the immediate financial penalties, what are the most severe potential consequences now facing both "Swift Deliveries Ltd" and Mr. Jones personally?

A.The only consequences are the automatic financial penalties against the company, and Mr. Jones bears no personal risk as his liability is limited.
B.The company will be automatically dissolved within 30 days, and Mr. Jones will be automatically disqualified from acting as a director for five years.
C.The company faces being struck off the register, and Mr. Jones risks personal liability for company debts and director disqualification proceedings.
D.The consequences are solely reputational, affecting the company's credit score but protecting Mr. Jones from any legal action.
E.The supplier's petition will be automatically successful, leading to immediate liquidation and criminal charges against Mr. Jones for the late filings.

Explanation

C is the correct option. Persistent non-compliance, especially after repeated warnings, empowers the Registrar to commence strike-off proceedings, which could lead to the company's dissolution. Furthermore, as outlined in the text, directors can face severe personal consequences for such failures. These include director disqualification proceedings for unfitness, which can bar them from acting as a director for 2-15 years. If the company continues to trade while insolvent, perhaps to pay the accumulating penalties, Mr. Jones could also face personal liability for the company's debts under the wrongful trading provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986.

A is incorrect because it ignores the significant personal risks for directors. While the company incurs financial penalties, a director who knowingly and persistently fails to ensure compliance is exposed to disqualification and, in insolvency, personal liability.

B is incorrect as the processes are not automatic. Strike-off requires a formal procedure, and disqualification requires an application to the court by the Secretary of State, which involves an assessment of the director's conduct.

D is incorrect as the consequences are legal and financial, not merely reputational. The public nature of the non-compliance can trigger actions from creditors and the registrar that have severe legal and financial outcomes for both the company and the director.

E is incorrect because it overstates the process. A creditor's petition for compulsory liquidation is not automatic; it requires a court hearing. While the filing history supports the petition, it does not guarantee its success. Criminal charges for simple late filing are not typical; the primary sanctions are civil and administrative.

Question 61 (BUSINESS LAW)



Eleanor, Fiona, and Grace have successfully operated a small artisan bakery as partners for two years without a formal partnership agreement. Their business has been consistently profitable, specializing in high-quality breads and pastries. Eleanor and Grace have now identified a prime location in a neighbouring town and are eager to expand the business by opening a second shop. This ambitious plan would require the partnership to take on a substantial bank loan to cover the costs of the new lease, renovations, and initial stock. 

They believe this expansion is a logical and necessary step for the business's long-term growth and increased market presence. Fiona, however, is perfectly content with their single, manageable shop and its current level of profit. Being deeply risk-averse, she is vehemently opposed to the expansion plan, fearing the potential financial burden of the loan and the significantly increased workload it would create for all of them. At a recent partners' meeting, Eleanor and Grace voted in favour of the expansion and outvoted Fiona. They have subsequently announced that they will proceed with securing the loan and the new location.

Can Eleanor and Grace lawfully proceed with the expansion plan based on the default statutory rules?

A.Yes, they can proceed as a majority of partners has approved the decision, which is sufficient for all ordinary matters.
B.No, they cannot proceed because a change to the nature of the partnership business requires the unanimous consent of all partners.
C.Yes, they can proceed because the expansion is in the best interests of the partnership and a dissenting partner cannot veto growth.
D.No, they cannot proceed because any decision to borrow money requires the unanimous consent of all partners under the default rules.
E.Yes, they can proceed, but only if they personally guarantee the loan, thereby insulating Fiona from any additional financial risk.

Explanation

B is the correct option. Under Section 24(8) of the Partnership Act 1890, "no change may be made in the nature of the partnership business" without the unanimous consent of all partners. Opening a second location with significant new financial commitments fundamentally alters the character, scale, and risk profile of the business, moving it from a single-site operation to a multi-site enterprise. This constitutes a change in its nature, not merely an ordinary day-to-day decision, and therefore requires Fiona's consent.

A is incorrect because the majority rule under the default settings applies only to "ordinary matters connected with the partnership business." A fundamental change like expanding to a new location and taking on substantial debt falls outside the scope of ordinary matters and specifically requires unanimity.

C is incorrect as the subjective view of what is in the partnership's best interests is irrelevant against the specific statutory requirement for unanimity for a change in the nature of the business. A minority partner has a statutory veto power over such fundamental changes.

D is incorrect because while borrowing money can be an ordinary matter if it is for the usual purposes of the existing business, the decision here is intrinsically linked to the fundamental change of expanding the business, which itself requires unanimity. The default rules do not state that all borrowing requires unanimity.

E is incorrect as personal guarantees do not override the statutory governance rules. The requirement for unanimous consent for a change in the nature of the business is a procedural prerequisite that cannot be bypassed by attempting to mitigate the financial risk for one partner.

Question 62 (BUSINESS LAW)

Isabella, Lorenzo, and Matteo are partners in a digital agency they founded three years ago. Isabella, the lead developer, works approximately sixty hours per week on complex technical projects. Lorenzo, the creative director, works a standard forty-hour week managing the design team and client presentations. Matteo, the strategist, works around twenty-five hours per week but secured the agency's foundational client roster. Their signed Partnership Agreement explicitly states in Article 5.1: "Net profits shall be divided as follows: Isabella 50%, Lorenzo 30%, and Matteo 20%." Following a highly profitable year, Matteo now argues he is entitled to an equal one-third share of the profits. He claims the default provision of the Partnership Act 1890 is inherently fairer and should override their specific written agreement, despite having consented to its terms.

Is Matteo entitled to an equal share of the profits?

Options:
A.Yes, because the default rule of equal sharing under the Partnership Act 1890 is a mandatory provision that cannot be overridden.
B.Yes, but only if a majority of the partners vote to revert to the statutory default rule for this financial year.
C.No, because a properly drafted and executed Partnership Agreement expressly overrides the default statutory rules.
D.No, but only if the other partners can prove that Matteo’s lower contribution justifies the unequal share.
E.Yes, because profit-sharing ratios must always be proportionate to capital contributions, not work effort.

C is the correct option

Explanation

C is the correct option. A fundamental purpose of a Partnership Agreement is to create a bespoke set of rules that displace the default, one-size-fits-all provisions of the Partnership Act 1890. The clause specifying profit shares of 50%, 30%, and 20% is a clear and valid contractual term that the partners have agreed upon. This agreement takes precedence over the statutory presumption of equality in Section 24(1), providing certainty and reflecting the partners' actual understanding and contributions.

A is incorrect because the default rules in the Partnership Act 1890 are precisely that; defaults. They apply only in the absence of a contrary agreement. The partners are expressly permitted to make their own arrangements, which will be legally binding.

B is incorrect as the Partnership Agreement is the governing document. A simple majority vote cannot override its terms; any change to the profit-sharing ratio would require an amendment to the agreement itself, following any procedure for variation set out within it.

D is incorrect because the enforceability of the clause does not depend on the other partners proving its fairness in court. The clause is binding as a matter of contract. The court's role is to interpret and enforce the agreement, not to reassess the commercial fairness of a bargain the partners freely entered into.

E is incorrect as there is no legal requirement for profit-sharing to be linked to capital contribution. A Partnership Agreement can apportion profits based on any criteria the partners choose, including time commitment, skill, or client generation, as is the case here.

Question 63 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
The Department for Transport, under Minister Sarah, launches a new, expensive computer system for managing the national rail network. The system, which was chosen by senior civil servants in the department after a lengthy but flawed procurement process, fails catastrophically on its first day, causing nationwide travel chaos and wasting hundreds of millions of pounds of public money. 

An independent inquiry finds that the failure was due to poor advice from civil servants and a flawed procurement process within the department, but it clears Minister Sarah of any personal wrongdoing or direct involvement in the decision. Opposition MPs and the media are calling for Minister Sarah's resignation, arguing that someone must be held accountable for the fiasco. The Prime Minister has expressed her "full confidence" in Minister Sarah. 

Which of the following statements best describes the constitutional convention that applies to Minister Sarah's situation?

a) The convention of collective responsibility requires her to resign because the government as a whole must bear responsibility for the failure.
b) The convention of individual ministerial responsibility holds her responsible for the actions of her department, and she is therefore expected to resign to uphold accountability.
c) As she has no personal legal liability, there is no constitutional obligation for her to resign; the matter is purely political.
d) The Prime Minister must dismiss her using the Royal Prerogative to maintain the government's reputation.
e) The convention requires her to resign only if she misled Parliament, which she did not.

B is the correct option. 
Explanation
B is the correct option. This accurately states the convention of individual ministerial responsibility. According to this convention, ministers are responsible for the overall performance and conduct of their departments, even if they are not personally at fault. 
A is incorrect. Collective responsibility applies to government policy and requires all ministers to publicly support decisions made in Cabinet. This failure is an operational disaster within a specific department, falling under the remit of individual responsibility.
C is incorrect. While the decision to resign is ultimately political and not legally enforceable, to say there is "no constitutional obligation" is wrong. There is a clear constitutional convention that creates a strong expectation and powerful political pressure to resign in the face of a serious departmental failure.
D is incorrect. The Prime Minister may pressure her to resign, but the prerogative power of dismissal is a formal power. The convention places the onus on the minister to offer their resignation to uphold the principle of accountability.
E is incorrect. While misleading Parliament is a particularly serious breach that would certainly demand resignation, it is not the only circumstance. A catastrophic departmental failure of this magnitude, costing vast public funds, is a recognised trigger for the operation of the convention.

Question 64 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
The Prime Minister, David, wishes to deploy British troops to a conflict zone in a foreign country to evacuate British nationals. He advises the Monarch to exercise the Royal Prerogative power to deploy the armed forces. The deployment is successful and all citizens are brought home safely. However, a pressure group argues that such a significant decision, which carries risks to life and international relations, should not be made by the Prime Minister alone using historical Crown powers and should require a debate and vote in Parliament. 

The government responds that the use of the prerogative in this area is a long-standing and efficient practice, vital for swift action in emergencies. The pressure group is considering lobbying for a new law. 

Which of the following statements best describes the constitutional relationship between Parliament and the Royal Prerogative power to deploy troops?
a) The Royal Prerogative is an absolute power and cannot be questioned or regulated by Parliament in any way.
b) Parliamentary Sovereignty means that Parliament could pass a statute to abolish or regulate the prerogative power of deployment, but it has not yet done so.
c) A constitutional convention now requires that the House of Commons must always give its approval before troops are deployed, making a vote legally necessary.
d) The courts, following the GCHQ case, have no jurisdiction to review the exercise of the prerogative power to deploy troops, as it is a matter of high policy.
e) The Monarch can refuse to exercise the prerogative power if she personally believes the deployment is unwise.

B is the correct option 

Explanation
B is the correct option. This is a precise and accurate statement. Parliament is sovereign and has the ultimate power. While the prerogative power to deploy troops still exists, Parliament could pass an Act (like the Fixed-term Parliaments Act did for dissolution) to replace it with a statutory requirement for approval. 
A is incorrect. The Royal Prerogative is a residual source of power that is subordinate to statute. Parliament is sovereign and can legislate to abrogate any prerogative power.
C is incorrect. While a convention known as the "Parliamentary Convention on Military Action" has developed, whereby the government should seek the approval of the Commons for substantive deployments, it is not yet a firmly established or legally binding requirement. It is a political practice, not a legal one.
D is incorrect. The GCHQ case established that the source of the power (prerogative) does not make it immune from judicial review. The court's ability to review depends on the subject matter. 
E is incorrect. By convention, the Monarch must act on the advice of ministers in the exercise of her prerogative powers. She has no personal discretion in matters of policy like this.

Question 65  (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)

The UK Parliament, concerned about a recent rise in cybercrime, passes the 'Cybersecurity Act 2024'. The Act grants the Home Secretary, a senior government minister, sweeping new powers to monitor online communications. David, a civil liberties campaigner, is deeply opposed to this law. He believes it is a draconian measure that infringes on fundamental privacy rights. 

David launches a public campaign, arguing that the courts should strike down the Act because it is unjust and undermines democratic freedoms. He also criticises the fact that the Home Secretary, who is an elected MP, will be responsible for wielding these new powers, arguing that it is wrong for a member of the executive to also be a member of the legislature. In response, the government states that the Act is a necessary tool for public safety and was passed with a clear majority in the House of Commons. 

What is the core constitutional position regarding David's challenge and his criticism of the Home Secretary's role?
a) The courts can strike down the Cybersecurity Act 2024 if they determine it disproportionately infringes the right to privacy.
b) The courts cannot strike down the Cybersecurity Act 2024 
c) The Home Secretary should resign from Parliament to avoid a conflict of interest before exercising powers under the Act.
d) The Home Secretary's role as both a government minister and an MP is a breach of the separation of powers.
e) The Home Secretary's role as both a government minister and an MP is a legitimate feature of the UK's fusion of powers.

B is the correct option 
Explanation
B is the correct option. It accurately reflects the core Diceyan doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty. Parliament is the supreme legal authority, and no person or body, including the courts, can override or set aside an Act of Parliament. The courts must enforce the Cybersecurity Act 2024 as the law of the land.
A is incorrect. This misstates the fundamental principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty. Under the UK constitution, as detailed in Chapter 2, the judiciary does not have the power to strike down or invalidate an Act of Parliament, no matter how unwise or unjust it may seem. The court's role is to interpret and apply statutes, not to question their validity.
C is incorrect. There is no constitutional requirement for ministers to resign from Parliament. In fact, the UK system is built on a fusion of powers, where members of the executive are drawn from and remain within the legislature. This is designed to ensure the government is accountable to Parliament.
D is incorrect. While the UK does not have a strict separation of powers, the overlap between the executive and legislature is not considered a "breach" but a defining characteristic known as the fusion of powers. This is a deliberate feature of the Westminster system.
E is incorrect. This accurately describes the constitutional reality. The fusion of powers means that the government (executive) is physically and politically embedded within Parliament (legislature). The Prime Minister, Cabinet, and other ministers are almost always Members of the House of Commons, making them accountable to it.


Question 66 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)

Minister Chloe is the Secretary of State for the Department of Transport. A major scandal erupts when it is revealed that her department awarded a multi-million pound contract for new trains to a company owned by her brother-in-law, without following the standard competitive tendering process. Minister Chloe had no personal knowledge of the award, which was handled by senior civil servants in her department. 
The Prime Minister and the rest of the Cabinet publicly express their full confidence in Minister Chloe. However, opposition MPs and the media are demanding her resignation, arguing that there has been a catastrophic failure of oversight within her department. Minister Chloe appears before a Select Committee and apologises for the "systemic failure" but states she was not personally involved. 

What is the core constitutional convention that applies to Minister Chloe in this situation?
a) Minister Chloe is protected by the convention of collective responsibility, meaning she cannot be personally blamed for the actions of her department.
b) Minister Chloe must resign immediately because the error occurred within her department, regardless of her personal knowledge.
c) The convention of individual ministerial responsibility means Minister Chloe is accountable to Parliament for the conduct of her department and may be expected to resign.
d) As the Prime Minister has expressed confidence in her, Minister Chloe is constitutionally safe and cannot be forced to resign.
e) The responsibility lies solely with the civil servants who made the decision, and they should be disciplined, not the minister.

C is the correct option 

Explanation
C is the correct option. This perfectly captures the convention of individual ministerial responsibility. Ministers are answerable to Parliament for the policies, actions, and failures of their departments, even if they were not personally at fault. In cases of serious failure, the convention dictates that the minister should resign to take responsibility.
A is incorrect. Collective responsibility refers to the duty of all ministers to publicly support government policy. This situation concerns a failure within a specific department, which falls under the separate convention of individual ministerial responsibility.
B is incorrect. While the convention can lead to resignation, it is not an automatic rule. The minister is responsible, but whether they resign depends on the seriousness of the error, whether they were personally involved, and the political context. It is a political, not a legal, enforcement.
D is incorrect. The Prime Minister's support is a significant political factor, but it does not override the constitutional convention. If the political pressure from Parliament and the public becomes too great, a minister may still be expected to resign to protect the government's overall credibility.
E is incorrect. While civil servants may face internal discipline, the constitutional convention of accountability places the political responsibility squarely on the minister. It is the minister, not anonymous civil servants, who is accountable to Parliament and the public.


Question 67 (LEGAL SYSTEM)

The Scottish Parliament passes the 'Education (Scotland) Act 2024', which abolishes university tuition fees for all Scottish students. The UK government at Westminster, which has a different policy for England, is concerned that this will create an unfair funding disparity and negatively impact the UK-wide budget. The UK Parliament subsequently passes the 'National Education Funding Act 2024', which imposes a UK-wide cap on public spending for university tuition support. This Act directly contradicts the Scottish legislation and effectively nullifies it. The Scottish First Minister condemns the Act, stating that education is a devolved matter and Westminster has violated a key constitutional convention by legislating in this area without the Scottish Parliament's consent. 

What is the core constitutional issue regarding the UK Parliament's action?

a) The UK Parliament acted unlawfully because education is a devolved matter and it has no legal power to legislate for Scotland on this issue.
b) The UK Parliament acted within its legal rights as the sovereign parliament, but its action is a significant breach of the Sewel Convention.
c) The Scottish Parliament should have used its legislative competence to block the UK Act before it received Royal Assent.
d) The UK Parliament's action is legitimate because it concerns a UK-wide financial matter, which is a reserved power.
e) The courts can strike down the National Education Funding Act 2024 for violating the devolution settlement.

B is the correct option 

Explanation
Option B is Correct: Under the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty, the UK Parliament retains the legal power to legislate on any matter, including devolved ones. However, under the Sewel Convention (now codified in Section 28(8) of the Scotland Act 1998), Westminster "will not normally" legislate on devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. While the convention is politically binding, the Supreme Court confirmed in Miller (No. 1) that it is not a legally enforceable rule that the courts can use to invalidate an Act of Parliament.
Option A is Incorrect: Education is a devolved matter, but Westminster is legally sovereign. It is not "unlawful" for them to legislate, merely a breach of convention.
Option C is Incorrect: The Scottish Parliament has no legal mechanism to "block" a Westminster Act. It can refuse a Legislative Consent Motion (LCM), but Westminster can still proceed legally.
Option D is Incorrect: While the UK budget is a broad concern, the subject matter here is education, which is specifically devolved. Therefore, the issue is not that the power is "reserved," but that Westminster is overreaching into a devolved area.
Option E is Incorrect: Due to Parliamentary Sovereignty, UK courts cannot strike down an Act of the UK Parliament (unlike Acts of the Scottish Parliament, which can be struck down if they are outside competence).

Question 68 (CONTRACT)

The "Metropolitan Council" published a detailed invitation to tender for a five-year school catering contract worth several million pounds. The invitation document was 50 pages long and stated in clause 1.1, "The Council does not bind itself to accept the lowest or any tender." "Nourish & Co.", a large catering firm, spent thousands of pounds preparing and submitting the most competitive and comprehensive bid. Confident of their success, they immediately leased new kitchen facilities and hired additional staff specifically for this contract. 

The Council, however, after a change in political leadership, decided not to award the contract to any external bidder and to manage the service in-house to create public sector jobs. Nourish & Co. claimed that by conducting a detailed and expensive tender process, the Council had made an implied offer to consider all conforming tenders, which they had accepted by submitting a costly bid, forming a collateral contract.

Does the Council have a contractual obligation to consider Nourish & Co.'s tender in good faith?

A. Yes, because an invitation to tender of this scale and detail carries an implied obligation to consider all submitted bids fairly and in good faith.
B. Yes, because Nourish & Co. incurred significant expenses in reliance on submitting their tender, creating an estoppel that prevents the Council from acting arbitrarily.
C. No, because an invitation to tender is an invitation to treat, and the submission of a bid is an offer which the Council is free to reject for any reason, including a change in policy.
D. No, because the Council explicitly reserved the right not to accept any tender in clause 1.1
E. No, because the contract was for services over a long duration and required a formal signed agreement to be binding, which was never executed.
D is the correct option 
Explanation
D is the correct option. The Council's explicit statement that it did not bind itself to accept any tender negates any argument that the invitation was an offer or that it implied any binding obligation to consider bids. It reinforces the standard position that the invitation was an invitation to treat (Spencer v Harding). 
A is incorrect. While in some specific contexts (like a process contract) an obligation to consider conforming tenders may arise, the default position is that an invitation to tender is an invitation to treat. The explicit reservation of rights in clause 1.1 makes it very difficult to imply such a term.
B is incorrect. Estoppel is a shield, not a sword, and cannot be used to create a primary contractual obligation to award a contract or to force a party into a contractual relationship they never agreed to.
C is incorrect. This states the classic legal position: the invitation is an ITT, and the bid is an offer.
 E is incorrect. While many service contracts are signed, a contract can be formed through offer and acceptance without a formal signed document. The issue here is that no offer was ever made by the Council.


Question 69 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

Industrial Flow Ltd (the Claimant) has served a negligence claim on BuildRight Corp (the Defendant) regarding faulty pipework. During the proceedings, the Defendant provides evidence that the work was actually performed by a sub-contractor, Pipes & Seals Ltd. The Claimant now wishes to add the sub-contractor as a second defendant to the existing action before the limitation period expires.
Which of the following best describes the procedural requirement for the Claimant to add Pipes & Seals Ltd as a second defendant?
A.The Claimant must obtain the court's permission to add the new party. 
B. The Claimant can add the party automatically by amending the Claim Form. 
C.The Claimant only needs the written consent of the original Defendant. 
D. The Claimant must wait for the Defendant to bring a Part 20 claim. 
E.The Claimant must discontinue the current claim and issue a new one.
The Correct Option: A
Explanation
Option A is correct. Under CPR 19.4, once a claim form has been served, a party may only be added, removed, or substituted with the court's permission. The court will generally grant this if it is "desirable" to resolve the matters in dispute.
Option B is incorrect. Automatic amendments to add parties are only permitted before the claim form has been served (CPR 17.1).
Option C is incorrect. The consent of the existing defendant does not remove the requirement for a court order under Part 19.
Option D is incorrect. While a defendant can bring in a third party, the claimant is entitled to apply to sue them directly.
Option E is incorrect. It is more efficient to add a party to the existing claim than to start entirely new proceedings.
Question 70 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION) 
John, a claimant issues a claim form at the County Court Money Claims Centre on 1st January 2025. The defendant is located within the jurisdiction of England and Wales. The claimant's solicitor, dealing with a heavy caseload, only arranges for the claim form and particulars to be served personally on the defendant on 5th May 2025. The defendant applies to the court to set aside the claim on the basis that it was not served within the required time limit.
Has the claimant complied with the time limit for serving the claim form under CPR Part 7?
A. Yes, because the claimant has 6 months from the date of issue to serve the claim form.
B. No, because the claim form must be served within 4 months of the date of issue.
C. Yes, because the time limit was extended automatically due to the claimant's solicitor's workload.
D. No, because personal service requires the claim form to be served within 2 months of issue.
E. It depends on whether the court grants an extension of time for service upon the claimant's application.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. CPR 7.5(1) states that for claims where the defendant is within the jurisdiction, a claim form must be served within 4 months of the date of issue. The claim form was issued on 1st January 2025. The last day for service was therefore 1st May 2025 (4 months later). Service was effected on 5th May 2025, which is outside this period and therefore invalid unless the court has previously granted an extension. The solicitor's workload is not a valid reason for an automatic extension. The defendant is entitled to have the claim set aside for invalid service (CPR 7.6, 11).  Therefore options A, C, D and E are incorrect.

Question 71  (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
A claim form is issued on 15th February 2025. The claimant's solicitor obtains a written order from the court on 10th April 2025, extending the time for service of the claim form by 28 days, to 13th May 2025. On Friday, 9th May 2025, at 4:45 p.m., the solicitor serves the claim form by email to the defendant's solicitor's generic email address, as permitted by agreement. The defendant's solicitor does not read the email until Monday, 12th May 2025, and argues it was served out of time.
Is the claim form deemed to have been served within the extended deadline?
A. No, because it was read by the defendant's solicitor only on 12th May, which is after the deadline.
B. Yes, because email service is deemed effective immediately upon sending.
C. No, because the email was sent after 4:30 p.m. on a Friday.
D. Yes, because the email is deemed served on the next business day after it was sent.
E. It depends on whether the defendant's solicitor had an auto-reply on their email acknowledging receipt.
The correct option is D.
Explanation:
Option D is correct. This tests the interaction between an extension order and the rules for deemed service by email. Under CPR 6.26, where a document is served by electronic means (e.g., email), the deemed day of service is the day after it was sent. Furthermore, PD 6A.4.1 clarifies that if the email is sent after 4:30 p.m. on a business day, it is treated as being sent on the next business day. Here, the email was sent at 4:45 p.m. on Friday, 9th May. Therefore, it is treated as being sent on the next business day, Monday, 12th May (PD 6A.4.1). The deemed day of service is then the day after it was deemed sent, i.e., Tuesday, 13th May. However, the extended deadline was 13th May. Therefore, service is deemed effective on the deadline day itself and is within time. The key is applying the correct sequence: 1) Adjust sending time due to 4:30 p.m. rule (deemed sent 12th May), 2) Apply the "day after" rule for email (deemed served 13th May). Therefore options A, B, C and E are incorrect.


Question 72 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Thomas was involved in a minor car accident on 1st January 2023 when another driver ran a red light and collided with his vehicle. He felt a slight twinge in his neck but thought nothing of it, assuming it was just minor whiplash that would resolve itself. Over the following year, the pain in his neck and shoulders worsened gradually, becoming a constant ache that interfered with his sleep and his ability to work at his computer. 

On 1st March 2024, after his GP could not diagnose the issue with basic examinations, he was referred to a specialist orthopaedic consultant. On 15th April 2024, the specialist, after reviewing MRI scans, informed Thomas that he had a serious spinal ligament injury that was likely caused by the car accident and was a significant, permanent impairment that would require ongoing physiotherapy. Thomas, now realising the long-term implications, instructs you on 1st May 2024.

 When does the limitation period for his personal injury claim expire?
A. The limitation period expired on 1st January 2026, being three years from the date of the accident.
B. The limitation period will expire on 1st March 2027, three years from the date he first sought specialist medical advice for the worsening pain.
C. The limitation period will expire on 15th April 2027, three years from the date he acquired the knowledge that his injury was  attributable to the accident.
D. He is already out of time because he should have brought the claim within one year of the accident, given that he was aware of some pain immediately.
E. The limitation period is six years from the date of the accident, as it is a claim connected to a road traffic incident.

C is the correct option
Explanation
C is the correct option. This option correctly applies the "date of knowledge" test from ss.11 and 14 of the Limitation Act 1980. Thomas's date of knowledge was 15th April 2024, when the specialist confirmed the significant, permanent injury and its attributability to the accident. Therefore, the three-year limitation period expires on 15th April 2027.
A is incorrect. For personal injury claims, the standard three-year period runs from the later of the date of the accident or the "date of knowledge." Since Thomas did not know the full extent or attributability of his injury immediately, the date of knowledge is later.
B is incorrect. While seeing his GP was a step in the process, the "date of knowledge" under s.14 of the Limitation Act 1980 is the date on which the claimant first had knowledge of all the key facts: that the injury was significant, and that it was attributable to the defendant's act or omission. On 1st March 2024, he knew it was worsening but did not yet have the expert confirmation of its significance and cause.
D is incorrect. The limitation period for personal injury is three years, not one year. The one-year period applies to defamation claims.
E is incorrect. The six-year period is for simple contract and tort claims not involving personal injury. All personal injury claims are subject to the primary three-year limitation period.

Question 73 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

Sarah slips on a wet floor in a supermarket, "ValueSave," on 1st June 2024, while reaching for an item on their top shelf, fracturing her wrist. The floor had just been mopped, but no warning signs were present. Her solicitor sends a detailed Letter of Claim to ValueSave's insurers on 1st July 2024, outlining the facts, the specific injury, the absence of warning signs, and the initial financial losses including lost earnings from her job as a hairdresser. 

The insurers acknowledge the letter promptly within five working days. They now need to investigate the incident, which involves obtaining witness statements from staff, reviewing CCTV footage, and checking their cleaning schedules.

 What is the latest date by which the insurers should provide a substantive response, stating whether they admit or deny liability, under the relevant Pre-Action Protocol?

A. They have 14 days from the date of the Letter of Claim to provide a full response.
B. They have 21 days from acknowledging the Letter of Claim to admit or deny liability.
C. They have 3 months from the date of their acknowledgment to investigate and provide a substantive response.
D. They have a maximum of two months from the date of their acknowledgment to investigate and provide a substantive response.
E. They have 30 days from the date of the accident to complete their investigations and make a decision.

C is the correct option.
Explanation
C is the correct option. This accurately reflects the key stage in the Personal Injury Protocol. The defendant has a maximum of three months from the date of acknowledging the Letter of Claim to investigate the allegations and then provide a substantive response, stating whether liability is admitted or denied and giving their reasons. Therefore D is incorrect.
A is incorrect. The 14-day period is for the initial acknowledgment of the Letter of Claim, not for the full, investigated response.
B is incorrect. The 21-day period mentioned in the Personal Injury Protocol is the time given to the defendant to acknowledge the Letter of Claim, not to provide the substantive response on liability.
E is incorrect. The Protocol timetable is triggered by the receipt of the Letter of Claim, not the date of the accident itself.

Question 74 (TORT)
Anya is a 38 year old delivery driver for "QuickCourier Ltd." While making a delivery in her marked van on 10th May 2024, she negligently reverses into and damages a parked Ferrari of the 2023 model owned by Ben. Anya, who is ordinarily a cautious and meticulous driver was running behind schedule because of the bad news she had heard that morning and, in a hurry, failed to check her mirrors properly.

 Ben who is furious for the damage done to his beloved vehicle has obtained clear CCTV footage from a neighbouring property showing the van, the QuickCourier logo, and the moment of impact. Ben wants to claim for the £3,000 cost of repairs from his garage. He is unsure whether to pursue the driver, the company, or both, and seeks your advice on the most effective way to proceed. 

Who is the correct defendant against whom Ben should bring his claim?

A. Ben should only sue Anya, as she was the individual who was driving negligently and is personally responsible for her actions.
B. Ben should only sue QuickCourier Ltd, as Anya was acting in the course of her employment at the time of the accident.
C. Ben should sue both Anya and QuickCourier Ltd as joint defendants to ensure he can recover his losses from at least one of them.
D. Ben should sue the owner of the parked car's insurance company directly, as this is a motor claim and that would be the fastest way to get paid.
E. Ben has no claim against QuickCourier Ltd because Anya is an independent contractor and the company is not responsible for her driving.

B is the correct option 

Explanation
B is the correct option. This correctly applies the principle of vicarious liability. Anya was acting in the course of her employment (making a delivery) at the time of the negligent act. Therefore, her employer, QuickCourier Ltd, is legally liable for the damage she caused. It is the most efficient and effective party to sue, as it will have the assets and insurance to meet the claim.
A is incorrect. The principle of vicarious liability makes her employer, QuickCourier Ltd, liable for torts committed by an employee in the course of their employment. .
C is incorrect. While it is technically possible to sue both, it is procedurally messy and unnecessary. The employer is primarily liable under the doctrine of vicarious liability, and they will have the insurance and assets to meet the claim. 
D is incorrect. A claim in negligence is brought against the tortfeasor (the person who committed the wrong) or their employer. A direct claim is not made against the other party's insurer until the enforcement stage, if at all.
E is incorrect. The scenario describes a delivery driver using a company van, which strongly suggests an employer-employee relationship, not that of an independent contractor. Even if she were a contractor, if QuickCourier Ltd retained a high degree of control, it could still be held liable, but the scenario points towards standard employment.



Question 75 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
In 2018, ShoddyBuild Ltd completed the construction of a house for Mr. and Mrs. Clarke. Unknown to the Clarkes, the foundations were structurally inadequate and did not meet building regulations. In January 2024, following a severe storm, a large crack appeared in the main supporting wall, and the upper floor began to sag.
The Clarkes immediately commissioned a structural engineer, whose report, received on 1 May 2024, confirmed that the damage was directly caused by the original 2018 construction defect. The report noted that this was a latent defect that could not have been discovered earlier without invasive and expensive testing. The Clarkes instructed a solicitor on 1 June 2024 to bring a claim in the tort of negligence.
What is the expiry date for the limitation period for the Clarkes to issue their claim in negligence?
A.2024; six years from the date of the original construction.
B.1 May 2027; three years from the date of knowledge of the latent damage. 
C. 1 June 2027; three years from the date the claimants first instructed a solicitor. 
D.1 May 2030; six years from the date the structural report was received. 
E. 2033; fifteen years from the date of the original negligent act.
The Correct Option: B
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under Section 14A of the Limitation Act 1980, for latent damage (excluding personal injury), the claimant has three years from the "starting date" (the date of knowledge) if that period expires later than the standard six-year limit. Knowledge was acquired on 1 May 2024, making the deadline 1 May 2027.
Option A is incorrect. The standard 6-year limit is overridden here by the latent damage rule.
Option C is incorrect because the starting date is based on knowledge of the damage/cause, not when legal advice was sought.
Option D incorrectly applies a 6-year period to the date of knowledge.
Option E is incorrect. This is the "long-stop" date (the absolute maximum time allowed), but it does not determine the specific expiry for this claim.

Question 76 (LEGAL SERVICES)

Michael runs a popular online blog called "The Legal Eagle," where he offers free advice on family law matters. He has no formal legal qualifications but is well-read and has personal experience with the family courts. His friend, Sarah, is going through a difficult separation. Overwhelmed and unable to afford a solicitor, she confides in Michael. He invites her to his home office, where he spends several hours reviewing her correspondence.

 He drafts a detailed Form C100 application for a child arrangements order, carefully wording the section on why the court should make the order to align with the welfare checklist. He prints the form, advises Sarah on which court to send it to, and signs the section designated for the "Applicant's Legal Representative," stating his name and "The Legal Eagle." He refuses any payment, seeing it as an act of friendship. 

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal and regulatory implications of Michael's actions?
A. Michael has not committed any offence because his assistance was free, voluntary, and given in a private capacity.
B. Michael has committed a criminal offence by conducting litigation, as he prepared a core court document for another person and held himself out as a legal representative.
C. Michael's actions constitute the exercise of a right of audience because he advised on the legal tests a court would apply.
D. Michael has engaged in a reserved instrument activity by drafting a formal legal instrument for use in a legal process.
E. Michael is safe because he only provided legal advice and guidance, which is not a reserved activity.

B is the correct option 
Explanation
B is the correct option. The "conduct of litigation" is a reserved activity. This includes the management of a case through the court system, which encompasses the preparation of key documents like a Form C100. By drafting this form, advising on its submission, and critically, signing it as the "Legal Representative," Michael has clearly undertaken a reserved activity for another person. 
A is incorrect. The prohibition on undertaking reserved legal activities under s.14 of the Legal Services Act 2007 is not contingent on the payment of a fee. The act itself, especially when coupled with holding oneself out by signing as the legal representative, is the violation. The public protection rationale is undermined whether the service is paid or free.
C is incorrect. The exercise of a right of audience involves personally addressing the court, such as making oral submissions. Providing written advice on legal tests and preparing documents is preparatory work that falls under the conduct of litigation, not advocacy.
D is incorrect. A reserved instrument activity is a specific term referring to the transfer of land or property, such as conveyancing. Drafting a court form for a family matter does not fall into this defined category.
E is incorrect. While providing general legal advice is not reserved, Michael's actions crossed a clear line. He moved from giving advice to actively preparing and formalising a court document, an integral part of the litigation process, thereby engaging in a reserved activity.

Question 77 (LEGAL SERVICES)

"QuickProbate Services" is a company run by individuals who are not legally qualified. They advertise extensively online, offering a "fast and affordable" probate service for executors who find the process daunting. Their service involves meeting with the executors, collecting all financial information, and completing all the necessary inheritance tax and probate application forms (IHT400 and PA1P). 

They charge a fixed fee of £1,500 for this form-filling and administrative service. The executors then sign and submit the forms themselves. Mrs. Davies uses their service but, after a dispute over the quality of the information-gathering process, refuses to pay the final invoice. The company is now considering its options. 

Which of the following are legal consequences that "QuickProbate Services" is likely to face as a result of its business model?

A. The company can successfully sue Mrs. Davies in the county court to recover its £1,500 fee for services rendered.
B. The company has committed a criminal offence by preparing probate papers for a fee without being authorised.
C. If Mrs. Davies had paid the fee, she would be entitled to recover it in full from the company.
D. The Grant of Probate obtained by Mrs. Davies is invalid and will be revoked by the Probate Registry.
E. The company's actions are permissible because the executors, who are authorised to apply, submitted the final forms.

B is the correct option 

Explanation
B is the correct option. Under s.14 of the Legal Services Act 2007, it is a summary offence for a person to pretend to be, or do anything that implies they are, entitled to carry on a reserved legal activity. Preparing papers for a grant of probate for a fee is a reserved "probate activity." By offering this service, the company is committing a criminal offence, punishable by a fine.
A is incorrect. In fact, the opposite is true. Under s.18 of the Legal Services Act 2007, an unqualified person who provides a reserved legal activity is not entitled to be paid any fees for that work. A court would not enforce this contract, rendering the invoice unenforceable.
C is incorrect. Following from s.18 of the Legal Services Act 2007, any contract for the provision of a reserved activity by an unauthorised person is unenforceable. Therefore, any money paid under that contract can be recovered by the client, as it was paid for an illegal service.
D is incorrect. The flaw is in the preparation of the papers by an unauthorised person, not necessarily in the resulting grant. The Probate Registry issues the grant based on the application submitted by the executor (who is entitled to apply). The grant itself is unlikely to be declared invalid after the fact solely due to who prepared the forms, but the preparers are still liable for their unauthorised actions.
E is incorrect. The reserved activity of "probate activities" is explicitly defined as preparing any papers for a grant of representation for a fee. The identity of the person who submits the papers to the registry is irrelevant to the classification of the company's service as a reserved activity.

Question 78 (LEGAL SERVICES)
David is an experienced and senior paralegal at "Stratton Solicitors," an SRA-regulated firm. He has worked in the commercial property department for ten years. His supervising partner, Fatima, asks him to take the lead on a high-value but procedurally straightforward office lease assignment. David's responsibilities include liaising with the other side, drafting the licence to assign and the deed of variation, and preparing the Land Registry application. David carries out all these tasks diligently and to a high standard. The documents are now ready for execution and submission. 

What must happen next for "Stratton Solicitors" to remain compliant with the rules governing reserved legal activities?

A. David can sign the transfer deed and submit the Land Registry application himself as he is a skilled and trusted employee of an authorised firm.
B. Fatima, as the supervising solicitor, must personally review, approve, and sign the key documents before they are used or submitted.
C. The firm must immediately apply to the SRA for David to be recognised as a licensed conveyancer based on his experience.
D. The firm can delegate this task fully to David, but the client must be informed and must provide explicit written consent.
E. David can finalise the documents, but they must be signed by a chartered legal executive from the litigation department.

B is the correct option 

Explanation
B is the correct option. The work can be delegated to a paralegal, but it must remain under the direct supervision and responsibility of an authorised person. The supervising solicitor (Fatima) must check the work, apply her professional judgment, and ultimately take responsibility for it by signing the documents. 
A is incorrect. A paralegal, regardless of experience, is not personally authorised to conduct reserved activities. The final, legally transformative acts, signing the deed and submitting the Land Registry application—are integral parts of the reserved instrument activity and must be performed by an authorised person.
C is incorrect. While David could choose to qualify as a licensed conveyancer, it is not a requirement for him to perform this work under supervision. The firm's authorisation allows its solicitors to supervise such work appropriately.
D is incorrect. While transparency with the client is a regulatory duty, client consent cannot override the statutory and regulatory requirement that reserved activities must be carried out by or under the supervision of an authorised person. The duty to the court and the regulatory system is non-delegable. E is incorrect.

Question 79 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
Mr Shedrack Lyon, an MP makes a speech in the House of Commons during a debate on national security. In the speech, the MP names a high-ranking intelligence officer, Mr Thomas Smith, accusing them of corruption. This information was previously protected by a court injunction. The intelligence officer wishes to sue the MP for defamation in the High Court.
Which of the following best describes the legal position regarding the MP’s liability?
A.The MP is liable because a court injunction overrules parliamentary privilege in matters of national security.
B. The MP is protected by absolute privilege and the speech cannot be questioned in any court
C. The MP is only protected if the Speaker of the House gave prior permission to disclose the name. 
D.The MP has qualified privilege, meaning they are only protected if they can prove the statement was made without malice. 
E.The MP is liable because parliamentary privilege does not apply to statements that name individuals protected by anonymity orders.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 provides that "the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament." This is absolute privilege. Even if an MP breaches a court injunction or acts with malice, the courts have no jurisdiction to adjudicate on "proceedings in Parliament." 
Option D is incorrect. Qualified privilege applies to certain reports of parliamentary proceedings (e.g., in newspapers), but the actual speech in the House is protected by absolute privilege.

Question 80 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
Thomas and Sarah are the leaders of a local environmental group. They decide to organize a public protest march to oppose the local council’s decision to build a parking lot over a community garden. They plan the march for Saturday, 25 October.
On Monday, 12 October, Thomas delivers a handwritten letter to the front desk of the local police station. The letter clearly states that the march will take place on 25 October, starting at 10:00 AM, beginning at the community garden and ending at the Town Hall. However, Thomas is worried about being targeted by pro-development counter-protestors.
 Consequently, he does not include his or Sarah's home address or full names in the letter, signing it simply as "The Garden Committee." He also omits the specific streets the march will follow, believing it is safer to keep the route flexible until the day of the event.
What is the legal consequence of these omissions under Section 11 of the Public Order Act 1986 if the march goes ahead?
A. The notice is valid because it was delivered more than six clear days in advance and provided the police with the critical start time and date.
B. The notice is invalid, and as organizers, Thomas and Sarah commit a criminal offense if the procession is held as planned.
C. The notice is valid, but the police may exercise their power under Section 12 to impose a "security fee" on the organizers for the administrative burden of determining the route.
D. The notice is invalid, but Thomas and Sarah have a complete defense under Article 11 of the ECHR)regarding their right to anonymity for security reasons.
E. The notice is valid, but the police are entitled to treat the procession as a "public assembly" (static protest) rather than a "public procession" (moving protest).
The Correct Option: B
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under Section 11(3) of the POA 1986, a valid statutory notice must specify:
1.The date of the procession;
2.The start time;
3.The proposed route; and
4.The name and address of at least one of the organizers.
By omitting the route and the name/address of the organizers, Thomas has failed to satisfy the mandatory statutory requirements. Under Section 11(7), if a procession is held and the requirements of the section have not been satisfied, each of the persons organizing it is guilty of a criminal offense (subject to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale).
Option A is incorrect because meeting the "6-day" delivery rule does not cure the failure to provide the mandatory information (route and address).
Option C is incorrect because the police have no statutory power to charge "security fees" for the processing of a Section 11 notice.
Option D is incorrect. While Article 11 protects the right to protest, the "notice" requirement is considered a proportionate and lawful restriction for public safety. Anonymity for organizers is not a recognized defense to the Section 11 requirements.
Option E is incorrect. The legal definitions of "procession" (moving) and "assembly" (static) are based on the nature of the event itself, not the validity of the notice provided.
Question 81 (LEGAL SYSTEM)
Jane was tapping on her window in her house in Central London and calling for men. The Street Offences Act makes it an offense for a prostitute to "loiter or solicit in a street or public place." Jane, the defendant is charged after tapping on a window and calling to men from a private balcony. The balcony is not technically "in the street." However, the court finds the defendant guilty, stating that the Act was intended to allow people to walk down the street without being molested or solicited. Jane feels the court misinterpreted the Street Offences Act. According to Jane, the word ‘street’ is pretty straightforward.
Which rule of statutory interpretation is most clearly being applied?
A.The Literal Rule. 
B. The Golden Rule.
C.The Mischief Rule.
D.The purposive approach
E.Ejusdem generis
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. This scenario is based on Smith v Hughes. The Mischief Rule (established in Heydon’s Case) requires the court to look at the common law before the Act, identify the "mischief" or defect the Act was intended to fix, and then interpret the statute to "suppress the mischief." Therefore, options A,B, D and E are incorrect.

Question 82 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Michael is a self-employed electrician entered into a contract with David, to rewire a house for £12,000. David paid a £6,000 deposit, but Michael failed to start the work on the agreed date and then informed David he was no longer available, citing a fictitious personal emergency. David has obtained two quotes from other electricians, both confirming that the work would now cost significantly more due to increased material prices and their own scheduling. 

Furious and out of pocket, David has decided to sue Michael to recover his £6,000 deposit and the additional costs he will now incur. The claim is defended, and the court is now considering how to manage the case. David wants a quick resolution but is concerned about legal costs, as he has already suffered a financial loss. He is representing himself with some guidance from the Citizens Advice Bureau but is unsure of the procedures. 

What should be the most appropriate procedural track for this claim?

A. The case will  be allocated to the Small Claims Track
B. The case will be allocated to the Fast Track
C. The case will be allocated to the Multi-Track
D. The case could be heard in either the County Court or the High Court, but the County Court is the default and most likely venue.
E. The commercial court.

A is the correct option 

Explanation
A is the correct option. It accurately identifies the correct track based on the claim's value (£6,000 is below the £10,000 small claims limit for most claims) and the context of a litigant in person seeking a cost-effective resolution.
B is incorrect. The claim value of £6,000 falls within the small claims limit. The Fast Track is for claims between £10,000 and £25,000. Since this claim is only for £6,000, it does not meet the financial threshold for the Fast Track, making this statement incorrect in the context of this specific case.
C is correct. This is a fundamental feature of the Small Claims Track designed to keep costs low and accessible for litigants in person. The general rule, as per the Civil Procedure Rules, is that the winning party cannot recover legal advice or representation costs from the losing party, though they can recover minimal fixed costs and court fees.

Question 83 (LEGAL SYSTEM)
The Official Secrets Act makes it an offense to obstruct a member of the armed forces "in the vicinity of" a prohibited place. A defendant is arrested for obstructing an officer while standing inside a prohibited airbase. 
The defendant argues that "in the vicinity of" means "near to," and since he was inside, he was not "in the vicinity." The court decides that "in the vicinity" should be interpreted to include being "inside" to avoid a result that is clearly absurd and contrary to Parliament’s intention.
Which rule of statutory interpretation has the court applied?
A.The Mischief Rule
B.  The Literal Rule: 
C. The Golden Rule: 
D. The Purposive Approach
E. The Ejusdem Generis Rule
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. This scenario is based on Adler v George. The Golden Rule is a modification of the literal rule. It is used when the literal meaning would result in an absurdity that Parliament could not possibly have intended. By interpreting "in the vicinity" to include "inside," the court prevented a nonsensical outcome. Therefore, options A,B. D and E are incorrect.

Question 84 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

Fatima has a long-term health condition that her employer has refused to make reasonable adjustments for, despite her providing extensive medical evidence. After months of stress and a deterioration in her health, she felt she had no choice but to resign, sending a resignation letter citing constructive dismissal. She feels she has been discriminated against under the Equality Act 2010 and constructively dismissed. She wants to bring a claim against her former employer for compensation and to highlight their poor practices.

Which of the following statements is CORRECT?
A. Fatima’s claim should be brought in the County Court.
B. Fatima’s claim should be brought in the High Court
C. Fatima’s case should be heard in the Family Court.
D. Fatima’s case should be heard in the Court of Protection.
E. Fatima’s claim should be brought in the Employment Tribunal.
Correct Option: E
Explanation:
E is correct. Statutory employment claims like discrimination and constructive dismissal fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Employment Tribunal, not the County Court nor the High court. Therefore, Options A, B  and D are incorrect. 
C is incorrect. The welfare of an adult who lacks capacity is governed by the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Protection, not the Family Court.


Question 85 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

A large pharmaceutical company, "PharmaGen," believes a rival company has produced a new anti-inflammatory drug that infringes its patented chemical compound. It is seeking legal advice on where to bring a claim for an injunction and substantial damages, as the rival's product is capturing a significant market share and causing irreparable harm to its business. The case is highly technical and will require expert evidence from pharmacologists. 

Separately, a group of local residents and environmental activists wishes to challenge a decision by a government minister to grant development consent for a new runway at a major international airport, arguing the minister failed to properly consider the project's environmental impact assessment regarding air quality and noise pollution, in breach of statutory duties. They seek to have the decision quashed.

 Which of the following statements correctly identify the appropriate specialist courts within the High Court for these matters?
A. PharmaGen's patent infringement claim should be issued in the Chancery Division of the High Court
B. The challenge to the minister's planning decision should be brought as a claim for judicial review in the Administrative Court.
C. Both of these actions could be started in the County Court due to their significant public importance and the need for an accessible forum for the citizens and the companies involved.
D. The Commercial Court, which is part of the King's Bench Division
E. The Family Division of the High Court would handle the judicial review claim as it involves the interests of families and communities affected by the environmental impact, making it a matter of social welfare.
A is the correct option 

Explanation
A is the correct option. It most precisely identifies the correct, specialist court for a patent infringement claim, which is a classic and exclusive function of the Chancery Division, clearly distinguishing it from the general commercial expertise of the Commercial Court and emphasising the specialised nature of the jurisdiction.
B is incorrect. The Administrative Court is the specialist court within the High Court's King's Bench Division that has exclusive jurisdiction to hear claims for judicial review of decisions made by public bodies, such as government ministers. It is the only court that can quash such a decision.
C is incorrect. While the County Court handles a vast range of civil claims, specialist and high-value claims like patent infringement and judicial review must be commenced in the High Court, which has the requisite expertise, authority, and procedures to handle such complex matters.
D is incorrect. While the Commercial Court handles complex business disputes, specialist patent matters are specifically allocated to the Chancery Division, which has judges with particular expertise in this highly technical and specialised area of law. 
E is incorrect. The Family Division deals with matters such as divorce, child welfare, and forced marriage protection orders. It does not handle judicial review of planning or environmental decisions, which fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Administrative Court within the King's Bench Division.

Question 86 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Ben purchased a new luxury refrigerator from 'CoolKitchens Ltd,' an online retailer, for £2,500. The refrigerator broke down completely within three months. Ben has rejected the goods and demands a full refund, which CoolKitchens has refused. Separately, Ben's landlord has refused to return his £1,000 tenancy deposit at the end of his tenancy without providing any legitimate reason.
Which of the following statements is CORRECT?
A.Ben’s refund claim must be issued in the High Court.
B. Ben’s deposit claim is for the County Court.
C. Ben’s refund claim is for the County Court Small Claims Track.
D. Ben’s deposit claim is for the First-tier Tribunal (Property Chamber).
E. Both claims can be heard together in the County Court.
Correct Option: D
Explanation:
D is correct. Disputes about unprotected tenancy deposits are specifically for the First-tier Tribunal (Property Chamber).
A is incorrect. A £2,500 claim does not meet the value or complexity threshold for the High Court.
B is incorrect. While the County Court can handle debt claims, the designated forum for tenancy deposit disputes is the Tribunal.
C is incorrect. The small claims limit for most goods claims is £1,000. A £2,500 claim would likely be allocated to the Fast Track.
E is incorrect. The claims involve different laws and parties and must be issued in their separate, appropriate forums.


Question 87 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
A complex contractual dispute is tried in the High Court before a High Court Judge sitting in the King's Bench Division. The case involves the interpretation of a novel clause in a standard form construction contract widely adopted across the industry concerning allocation of risk for delays caused by unforeseen ground conditions. 

There is no binding precedent directly on point, though there are two conflicting Court of Appeal decisions on related contractual interpretation issues. The High Court Judge feels bound by one of these Court of Appeal decisions and rules against the claimant, but certifies that the case involves a point of law of general public importance relating wholly to statutory interpretation of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996. Both parties agree the case should go straight to the Supreme Court given its industry-wide importance. The claimant's solicitor begins preparing a leapfrog appeal application. The defendant consents in writing to the leapfrog procedure.

Can a leapfrog appeal proceed directly from the High Court to the Supreme Court?
A. Yes, because both parties consent to the leapfrog procedure and the High Court Judge has certified the case involves a point of general public importance.
B. No, because leapfrog appeals require the High Court Judge's certificate, both parties' consent, and the Supreme Court's permission.
C. Yes, because the case involves interpretation of a statute, which automatically qualifies for the leapfrog procedure under the Administration of Justice Act 1969.
D. No, because leapfrog appeals are only available in criminal cases, not civil commercial disputes.
E. Yes, because the existence of two conflicting Court of Appeal decisions makes it pointless to appeal to the Court of Appeal first.
The correct option is B.

Explanation:
Option B is correct because it accurately identifies all conditions required for a leapfrog appeal under the Administration of Justice Act 1969. The trial judge must grant a certificate, the case must involve a point of law of general public importance relating wholly or mainly to statutory interpretation or where the judge is bound by previous authority, all parties must consent, and the Supreme Court itself must grant permission. As demonstrated in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017], all conditions must be met. The scenario confirms the first three but does not state that Supreme Court permission has been obtained.
Option A is incorrect because judge's certificate and parties' consent alone are insufficient. The Supreme Court must also grant permission for the leapfrog appeal.
Option C is incorrect because statutory interpretation cases do not automatically qualify. All the statutory conditions, including Supreme Court permission, must still be satisfied.
Option D is incorrect because leapfrog appeals are available in both civil and criminal cases, not limited to criminal cases only.
Option E is incorrect because conflicting Court of Appeal decisions alone do not bypass the need to satisfy all statutory leapfrog conditions, particularly Supreme Court permission.



Question 88 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

A defendant is convicted in the Magistrates' Court of common assault following a trial before three lay magistrates. The defendant had pleaded not guilty and gave evidence in his own defence, claiming he acted in self-defence. The magistrates rejected his account, preferring the evidence of the complainant and an independent witness. The defendant is sentenced to a community order requiring 80 hours of unpaid work. 

The defendant remains convinced of his innocence and believes the magistrates were wrong to reject his self-defence argument. He also believes that one of the witnesses against him was not credible and that if the case were heard again, he could present his defence more effectively. The defendant did not have legal representation at his trial but now instructs a solicitor who advises that he has options to challenge the conviction. The solicitor explains the different routes available for challenging the magistrates' decision and the procedures involved in each route.

What is the defendant's position regarding appealing his conviction from the Magistrates' Court?
A. The defendant must apply for permission to appeal to the Crown Court and demonstrate that the appeal has a real prospect of success.
B. The defendant has an automatic right to appeal to the Crown Court, where the case will be completely re-heard with witnesses giving evidence again.
C. The defendant can only appeal on a point of law by way of case stated to the High Court, not to the Crown Court.
D. The defendant cannot appeal because he did not have legal representation at the Magistrates' Court trial.
E. The defendant must first apply to the Magistrates' Court for permission to appeal before the Crown Court can hear the case.

The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct because it accurately states that a defendant convicted in the Magistrates' Court has an automatic right to appeal to the Crown Court without needing permission. This is a key exception to the usual rule that appeals require permission. The appeal takes the form of a complete re-hearing before a Crown Court Judge and usually two magistrates. The case is heard again from the beginning with witnesses giving evidence afresh. This provides a relatively quick and accessible route for defendants to challenge magistrates' decisions on both conviction and sentence.
Option A is incorrect because permission is not required for appeals from the Magistrates' Court to the Crown Court. The right of appeal is automatic.
Option C is incorrect because whilst appeal by case stated to the High Court is one route (for points of law), it is not the only route. Appeals on fact and mixed fact/law can be made to the Crown Court.
Option D is incorrect because the absence of legal representation at trial does not prevent a right of appeal. The right exists regardless of representation status.
Option E is incorrect because no application for permission is required to the Magistrates' Court. The defendant simply files a notice of appeal with the Crown Court.

Question 89 (LEGAL SYSTEM)

The government, concerned about a rise in single use plastics, decides to introduce a new law to ban a range of such products. The relevant government department, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, first publishes a consultation document titled "Tackling Plastic Pollution: A Consultation on Prohibiting Single Use Plastics." This document outlines the scale of the problem, presents several potential policy options, from a voluntary industry agreement to a full ban, and invites responses from manufacturers, environmental groups, and the public. 

After analysing the consultation responses, which show overwhelming support for a legislative ban, the government publishes a follow up document, "The Single Use Plastics Bill: Policy Statement," which firmly commits to a ban and sets out the key provisions the intended Bill will contain. 

What is the correct term for this second, policy committed document that serves as the formal blueprint for the subsequent Bill?
A. A Green Paper.
B. A White Paper.
C. A Draft Bill.
D. A Select Committee Report.
E. A Ministerial Statement.

Correct answer is B.
Explanation:
B is correct because a White Paper is a document issued by the government that sets out firm policy proposals for a new law. It is a statement of intent, often following a consultation on a Green Paper, and serves as the detailed blueprint from which a Bill is drafted.
A is incorrect because a Green Paper is a tentative discussion document, the first one described in the scenario, which is designed to promote public debate and consultation on a subject without committing the government to a specific course of action.
C is incorrect because a Draft Bill is a preliminary version of the actual legislation itself, which may be published for pre legislative scrutiny. The scenario describes a policy statement, not the legislative text.
D is incorrect because a Select Committee Report is produced by a parliamentary committee, not the government, and typically provides scrutiny and recommendations on government policy or draft legislation.
E is incorrect because a Ministerial Statement is an oral or written announcement made by a minister to Parliament, often to update on policy or events. It is not a detailed policy document that serves as a blueprint for legislation.

Question 90 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)

A backbench MP, Sarah Jones, is deeply concerned about the environmental impact of disposable barbecue grills, which have been linked to several serious heathland fires. She wishes to introduce a Bill to ban their sale and use in all national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. As she is not a government minister, she must enter a ballot to win the limited parliamentary time allocated for this type of legislation. She is successful in the ballot and introduces the "Disposable Barbecues (Prohibition) Bill." The Bill receives its First Reading, which is a formality. It then proceeds to a Second Reading, where its general principles are debated. Despite receiving cross party support, the government does not allocate any of its own parliamentary time to the Bill, and it ultimately runs out of time before the end of the parliamentary session, causing it to "fall." 

What is the correct term for a Bill of this type, introduced by an MP or Lord who is not a government minister?

A. A Government Bill.
B. A Private Bill.
C. A Private Member's Bill.
D. A Hybrid Bill.
E. A Public Bill.

Correct answer is C.
Explanation:

C is correct because a Private Member's Bill is a Bill introduced by an MP or Lord who is not a government minister. They have less time allocated for debate than government Bills and consequently have a lower chance of becoming law unless they garner government support. Their progress is often subject to procedural delays and a lack of parliamentary time.

A is incorrect because a Government Bill is introduced by a minister and forms part of the government's official legislative programme. It is given priority in the parliamentary timetable.
B is incorrect because a Private Bill is one designed to affect a particular individual, organisation, or local area, rather than the general public. For example, a Bill to grant specific powers to a local authority or a railway company would be a Private Bill. A ban on disposable barbecues is a measure of general application, making it a Public Bill.
D is incorrect because a Hybrid Bill is a Public Bill that affects a particular private interest in a manner different from the private interests of other persons or bodies in the same category. It has characteristics of both a Public and a Private Bill. A large infrastructure project like HS2 is a classic example. A general environmental ban does not typically have these specific private characteristics.
E is incorrect because while a Private Member's Bill is a type of Public Bill (as it changes the general law), the question specifically asks for the term that distinguishes it as being introduced by a backbencher. "Public Bill" is a broader category that also includes Government Bills.
