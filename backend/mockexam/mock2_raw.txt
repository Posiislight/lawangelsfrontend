Question 1 (Business Law and Practice: Directors’ Duties)
Arthur and Benedict have been close friends for years. They frequently discussed starting a business together importing Italian ceramics. Over coffee one afternoon, they verbally agreed to "go into the venture together." Arthur used his industry contacts to source products, while Benedict used his savings to pay a £10,000 deposit to a supplier. 

They rented a small warehouse unit, with the lease agreement signed by both of their names. They did not create a written partnership agreement, assuming their handshake and mutual understanding was sufficient. After the first shipment of ceramics arrived damaged and unsellable, the supplier is demanding payment of the remaining £40,000. Benedict now claims that no legally binding partnership was ever created due to the lack of formalities. The supplier is seeking to hold both men personally liable.

Is the supplier likely to succeed in arguing that a partnership existed between Arthur and Benedict?

A.No, a partnership cannot exist because there was no written partnership agreement signed by both parties.
B.No, a partnership requires registration with Companies House, which was not completed.
C.Yes, a partnership can be created by the conduct of the parties, and their actions indicate they were carrying on a business in common with a view to profit.
D.Yes, but only Benedict is liable as he was the only one who contributed capital to the business.
E.No, because their agreement was only verbal and made in a social setting, it lacks the necessary commercial intent.

Explanation

C is the correct option. A partnership is created by the conduct of the parties and does not require any formalities, such as a written agreement or registration. The definition under the Partnership Act 1890 is satisfied if persons are "carrying on a business in common with a view of profit." Here, their conduct, a verbal agreement, joint action in securing a lease, Arthur sourcing products, and Benedict providing capital, demonstrates they were operating a business together with a profit-making intention. The informality of their arrangement is irrelevant to its legal existence.

A is incorrect because a written agreement is not a legal requirement for the formation of a partnership. A partnership can be created orally or implied purely from the conduct of the parties, as governed by the Partnership Act 1890.

B is incorrect as partnerships are unincorporated entities and are not required to be, and indeed cannot be, registered at Companies House. This is a fundamental distinction between partnerships and incorporated entities like companies and LLPs.

D is incorrect because in a partnership, liability is joint and several. If a partnership is found to exist, both partners are liable for its debts, regardless of which partner incurred the obligation or contributed more capital.

E is incorrect because the context of an agreement does not preclude it from having legal effect. The key is the substance of their actions, which demonstrated a joint business venture. The initial conversation, followed by concrete steps, can form a binding partnership.

Question 2 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
Paul brings a claim against Richard for breach of a software development contract. During standard disclosure, Richard discloses a limited number of emails but does not search archived email accounts or instant messaging platforms used by his staff. Richard argues that searching those systems would be expensive and time-consuming. Paul believes relevant discussions took place on those platforms and challenges the adequacy of Richard’s search.
How will the court assess whether Richard has complied with his disclosure obligations?
A. By requiring Richard to search every possible source regardless of cost
 B. By considering whether Richard conducted a reasonable and proportionate search
 C. By requiring proof that relevant documents actually exist
 D. By excluding electronic documents from standard disclosure
 E. By ordering disclosure only of documents Richard relies on
Correct Answer: B
Explanation
●B is Correct. The test is whether the party conducted a reasonable and proportionate search, considering factors such as cost, complexity, and importance of the case.

●A is Incorrect. The CPR does not require exhaustive searches regardless of cost.

●C is Incorrect. Proof of existence is not required at this stage.

●D is Incorrect. Electronic documents are fully within the scope of disclosure.

E is Incorrect. Disclosure includes adverse documents, not just relied-upon documents.

Question 3 (CONTRACT)

AquaCorp PLC entered into a contract with HydroTech Solutions Ltd to construct a bespoke, high-pressure industrial filtration system for AquaCorp's new deep-sea research facility. The contract price was £5 million. The contract contained a clause stating that if any element of the construction was delayed by more than six months due to force majeure, either party could terminate.
Two weeks after the contract was signed, the government, citing a newly discovered, unique ecological habitat, passed emergency secondary legislation designating the deep-sea area where the facility was to be built as a highly protected zone, making any commercial construction or operation permanently illegal. HydroTech Solutions Ltd has spent £500,000 on raw materials and preparatory designs. AquaCorp PLC wishes to recover the full contract price.
Which of the following best describes the legal position?
A. Contract voidable under force majeure; HydroTech liable for damages.
B. Contract frustrated; HydroTech can claim £500,000 under quantum meruit.
C. Contract frustrated by supervening illegality; HydroTech can claim a just sum for expenses.
D. Contract frustrated; force majeure clause allocates risk; no recovery.
E. Contract void ab initio for mistake; parties restored to pre-contract positions.

The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The government action creating permanent illegality is frustration by supervening illegality. The force majeure clause is ineffective as it only addresses delay, not permanent prohibition. The Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 applies. Under s.1(2), HydroTech can recover a 'just sum' for expenses incurred (£500,000).
Option A is incorrect. Frustration terminates automatically; the contract is not merely voidable. The force majeure clause is too narrow to cover this event.
Option B is incorrect. While the contract is frustrated, recovery is governed by the statutory regime for a just sum under the 1943 Act, not common law quantum meruit.
Option D is incorrect. The force majeure clause is inapplicable. The 1943 Act overrides the common law "loss lies where it falls" rule, allowing expense recovery.
Option E is incorrect. The contract is discharged by frustration from the date of the event, not void ab initio. Mistake requires the illegality to exist at the time of contract formation.



Question 4 (Business law)

Investor X, a sophisticated private equity professional, was considering a significant investment in ChemCorp Ltd. X did not retain an advisor but instead relied on ChemCorp Ltd's most recent published annual audited accounts. These accounts were prepared and certified by Auditors LLP. The accounts were also publicly filed at Companies House. Following the investment, ChemCorp Ltd went into liquidation when it was discovered that Auditors LLP had negligently failed to identify a massive hidden liability, making the company insolvent at the time the accounts were published. Investor X lost £10 million. X now intends to sue Auditors LLP for the entirety of the lost investment.

Which of the following best describes the legal position regarding Auditor LLP's liability for Investor X's  loss?

A.Auditors LLP is liable because, as a matter of public policy, it is foreseeable that published accounts will be relied upon by anyone making an investment decision.
B. Auditors LLP is not liable because the reliance was not necessary
C. Auditors LLP is not liable because the loss is purely economic, and the necessary special relationship for a duty of care did not exist.
D. Auditors LLP is liable because the loss was a direct result of their negligent statement.
E. Auditors LLP is not liable because a duty of care for pure economic loss can only arise if the negligent statement was made fraudulently or recklessly.

The correct option is C.


Explanation
Option C is correct. This scenario is governed by the Caparo Industries v Dickman principles. For pure economic loss from negligent misstatement, a duty of care requires a special relationship (proximity). This is satisfied only if: (1) the statement was made for a specific, known purpose; (2) the advisor knew the advisee (or a known class) would rely on it for that purpose; and (3) the reliance was acted upon. Publicly filed accounts fail the proximity test for an unknown investor making a specific investment, as the auditor lacks knowledge of the specific transaction.

Option A is incorrect. This reflects the general foreseeability test, which was explicitly rejected by the House of Lords in Caparo for pure economic loss from published accounts.Option B is incorrect.
Option D is incorrect. This option incorrectly treats reasonable reliance and factual causation as sufficient. The law imposes an additional requirement of legal proximity (the special relationship) to establish a duty for pure economic loss.
Option E is incorrect. This describes the required fault level for the tort of deceit (fraud), not negligence. A claim in negligence requires only a breach of a duty of care, but a duty of care does not arise here.

Question 5 (Constitutional law)
The Secretary of State (SoS) was tasked with confirming or rejecting an application by a large infrastructure company to build a national pipeline. The relevant statute required the SoS to "take into account all relevant technical reports and to provide clear, written reasons for the final decision." A pressure group, GreenWatch, challenged the SoS's decision to approve the pipeline. GreenWatch discovered that, while the SoS mentioned consulting the reports, the official decision letter failed to specifically address the findings of the independent chief scientific advisor's report, which had concluded the environmental damage would be 'catastrophic' and had recommended rejection. The SoS later stated that he had merely 'skimmed' the report before signing the approval.

On which of the following grounds of judicial review is GreenWatch most likely to succeed?

A.Ultra vires
B.Procedural Impropriety 
C. Illegality
D. Substantive Unreasonableness
E. Unreasonableness

The correct option is B.

Explanation
Option B is correct. The failure to genuinely "take into account" a factor that the statute expressly makes mandatory is a Breach of Statutory Duty and falls under the head of Procedural Impropriety. The SoS's admission of 'skimming' and the decision's failure to reflect serious consideration of the report demonstrates this breach.Option A is incorrect. 

Option C is incorrect. The SoS had the statutory authority to make a decision (approve or reject); therefore, the decision was not outside their jurisdiction (ultra vires). The error relates to the method of decision-making, not the extent of the power.
Option D is incorrect. The Wednesbury test for unreasonableness is extremely high. When a clear procedural error (like failing to consider a mandatory factor) is available, it is the much more appropriate and easily provable ground.
Option E is incorrect. The SoS did provide written reasons as required by the statute. The failure is the lack of consideration of the key report during the decision process, not a failure to produce the document detailing the reasons.


Question 6 (contract law)
AgriCorp Ltd contracted with Precision Engineering PLC for the delivery of bespoke harvesting machinery, specifying a completion deadline of 1st September. The contract included a clause stating that in the event of any delay, Precision Engineering PLC would pay liquidated damages calculated at a rate of £10,000 per day of delay. 
This figure was chosen by AgriCorp's legal team, who internally calculated that their maximum provable loss due to delay would be £4,000 per day, based on expected lost yields. Precision Engineering PLC is now three weeks late and is disputing the clause's enforceability, claiming its purpose was to compel performance rather than compensate loss, citing the considerable difference between the calculated loss and the contractual rate.
Which of the following legal classifications best describes the consequence of the clause?
A. The clause is valid as liquidated damages, provided both parties are commercial entities.
B. The clause is a penalty and therefore automatically void and unenforceable.
C. The clause is enforceable if the detriment is not exorbitant or unconscionable.
D. The clause is a penalty and only enforceable up to the calculated £4,000 loss per day.
E. The clause is enforceable unless it is out of all proportion to any legitimate commercial interest.
The correct option is E.
Explanation
Option E is correct. The Modern Legal Test: The traditional distinction between a genuine pre-estimate of loss (liquidated damages) and a deterrent (penalty) was significantly revised by the UK Supreme Court in Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi (2015). The new test is not simply whether the sum is a genuine pre-estimate of loss, but whether it is "out of all proportion to any legitimate interest" of the innocent party in enforcing the primary obligation.


Option A is Incorrect. The fact that both parties are commercial entities is relevant (the courts are less likely to interfere in such bargains), but it is not determinative. A clause can still be a penalty between commercial parties if it is extravagant and unconscionable.
Option B is Incorrect. Since the Cavendish ruling, a penalty clause is not "automatically void." It is unenforceable to the extent it is penal. The rest of the contract typically remains valid.
Option C is Incorrect. The language of "exorbitant or unconscionable" harks back to the older, secondary test. The primary modern test is the "out of all proportion" standard.
Option D is Incorrect. The courts do not have the power to "rewrite" a penalty clause to make it enforceable at a lower rate. If a clause is found to be a penalty, the court will not enforce it. The injured party must then prove its actual, un-liquidated losses (which, here, would be up to £4,000/day).

Question 7 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
The Scottish Parliament (SP) passed the Local Council Elections (Scotland) Act 2025, which changed the voting age for local government elections to 16, exercising its devolved power. The UK Parliament subsequently passed the Security and Borders Act 2026, which establishes national security measures. This UK Act contains a specific provision stating that the voting age for all elections, including local elections in every part of the UK, is 18. The provision regarding local elections was inserted without seeking the Legislative Consent Motion (Sewel Convention consent) from the Scottish Parliament, in breach of the political convention.
What is the most likely legal effect of the UK Act regarding the local voting age in Scotland?
A. The UK Act provision is void due to a breach of the mandatory Sewel Convention.
B. The Scottish Act remains valid because the UK Parliament cannot legislate on devolved matters.
C. The Scottish Parliament Act is implicitly repealed by the UK Act under the doctrine of lex posterior derogat priori.
D. The UK Act is valid and overrides the Scottish Act 
E. The UK Act provision is ultra vires as it did not receive a Legislative Consent Motion from the Scottish Parliament.
The correct option is D.

Explanation
Option D is correct. Under the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty, the UK Parliament remains legally supreme and retains the power to legislate on any matter, including devolved matters, even if it breaches the Sewel Convention (a political convention, not a legal rule). The later-in-time UK Act is therefore valid and overrides the earlier Scottish Act.
Option A is incorrect. The Sewel Convention is a political convention, not a legal rule, and its breach does not invalidate a UK Act.
Option B is incorrect. This directly contradicts the principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty. The UK Parliament can legally legislate on devolved matters.
Option C is incorrect. While the principle lex posterior derogat priori (a later law repeals an earlier one) is correct, the underlying constitutional doctrine that enables this hierarchy is Parliamentary Sovereignty. Option D is the more precise constitutional answer.
Option E is incorrect. The UK Act is valid. The Legislative Consent Motion is linked to the Sewel Convention, which is not a source of legal invalidity.
Question 8 (TORTS)
Apex Construction Ltd is the occupier of a derelict commercial warehouse site that has been fenced off, though a small gap exists in the perimeter fence which Apex is aware of. A clear sign warning of 'DANGER: KEEP OUT' is posted at the main entrance, but not near the known gap. On a Sunday evening, a 15-year-old child, knowing of the risk but intending to retrieve a lost football, enters through the gap. The child falls into a poorly covered, known trench and suffers a serious leg injury. The child's parents are suing Apex Construction Ltd under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984 (OLA 1984).
Which factor is determinative of the occupier's duty of care under the OLA 1984?
A. Whether the child's age meant they could appreciate the inherent danger of a demolition site.
B. Whether the occupier had reasonable grounds to believe the child was a trespasser on the land.
C. Whether the occupier knew of the danger and had reasonable grounds to believe of the presence of the trespasser.
D. Whether the warning sign at the main entrance was sufficient to deter a casual visitor from entering the site.
E. Whether the child's presence on the land, given the gap in the fence, was reasonably foreseeable by the occupier.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The duty of care owed to non-visitors (trespassers) under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984, s.1(3) is conditional. The duty arises if, at the relevant time, the occupier: (a) knows of the danger (the trench); and (b) has reasonable grounds to believe the non-visitor is, or may come, into the vicinity of the danger (the known gap). The satisfaction of these two criteria triggers the duty.
Option A is incorrect. The age of the claimant (and their appreciation of risk) is relevant to whether the occupier has discharged their duty (s.1(3)(c)), but it does not determine if the duty exists in the first place.
Option B is incorrect. The occupier must have reasonable grounds to believe the trespasser may come into the vicinity of the danger, which is a more specific requirement than merely believing they are a trespasser.
Option D is incorrect. The adequacy of the warning sign (s.1(5)) relates to whether the occupier has discharged the duty once it has arisen, not whether the duty is owed.
Option E is incorrect. Foreseeability of the presence of the non-visitor is a necessary component but must be coupled with the occupier's knowledge of the danger to satisfy s.1(3)(a) and (b).

Question 9 (BUSINESS LAW)
SolarTech Private Ltd has issued capital of £500,000, all of which is fully paid up. The company has consistent surplus funds and wishes to reduce its share capital by £100,000 and return this amount to its shareholders to improve capital efficiency. As a private company, SolarTech wishes to use the least complex and least time-consuming method available under the Companies Act 2006, avoiding court involvement. 
Which procedure must the private company follow to effect the capital reduction?
A. A special resolution of members followed by an application to the High Court for confirmation.
B. A special resolution supported by a solvency statement, registered with the Registrar of Companies.
C. An ordinary resolution followed by a solvency statement, registered with the Registrar of Companies.
D. A special resolution and payment of the amount out of capital under the statutory redemption rules.
E. An ordinary resolution of members and a board resolution to amend the company's articles.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The simplified, court-free capital reduction procedure for a private company under s.642-644 Companies Act 2006 requires: (1) Approval by a Special Resolution (s.642); (2) A Solvency Statement signed by all directors (s.643); and (3) Filing these documents with the Registrar of Companies (s.644).
Option A is incorrect. This describes the Court confirmation procedure, which is the mandatory method for public companies and the complex optional method for private companies.
Option C is incorrect. The capital reduction requires a Special Resolution (75% majority), not merely an Ordinary Resolution (s.642).
Option D is incorrect. Reduction out of capital is the procedure used for the redemption or purchase of a company's own shares and is separate from the general capital reduction procedure.
Option E is incorrect. The procedure requires a Special Resolution and a Solvency Statement, not merely an Ordinary Resolution.
Question 10 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)

A solicitor in a small firm has been instructed by Client A, a property developer, to draft the standard commercial contract for the sale of a large retail unit in a new development. Separately, the same solicitor is approached by Client B, a small business owner, to advise on and negotiate the terms of a lease for a different retail unit in the same new development, being leased by Client A. 

The solicitor holds specific confidential information about Client A's financial projections and minimum acceptable yield for the entire development, which is highly relevant to Client B's ability to negotiate favourable rent and lease terms.

What action is the solicitor primarily required to take under the SRA Code of Conduct for Solicitors? 
A. The solicitor must refuse to act for both Client A and Client B.
B. The solicitor must establish information barriers between the two matters.
C. The solicitor can act for both clients if both give informed written consent.
D. The solicitor must seek approval from the SRA before continuing to act.
E. The solicitor must act only for the client who instructed them first in time.
The correct option is A.
Explanation
Option A is correct. This is an unmanageable conflict of interest under SRA Code of Conduct, Paragraph 6.2. The solicitor holds confidential information about Client A (the minimum yield) that is directly relevant to Client B's objective (negotiating a lower rent). The duty of confidentiality to Client A conflicts with the duty to act in the best interests of Client B. In this situation, the conflict is not manageable through consent or information barriers, meaning the solicitor must refuse to act for both.
Option B is incorrect. Information barriers (Chinese Walls) are generally insufficient to manage a conflict involving confidential information held by the same solicitor regarding similar, adverse transactions.
Option C is incorrect. The SRA distinguishes between minor, manageable conflicts (like Competing for the Same Objective) and unmanageable conflicts involving confidential information, where consent is insufficient to overcome the ethical breach.
Option D is incorrect. The SRA does not provide pre-approval for conflict situations; the solicitor must make the compliance decision themselves.
Option E is incorrect. SRA rules do not prioritise instructions based on the time they were received. The decision rests solely on the manageability of the conflict.
Question 11 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
Mia, the Secretary of State  for Energy, has statutory power under the Energy Development Act 2024 to grant or refuse licenses for new power generation projects on a case-by-case basis, subject to public interest. Concerned about potential over-supply, Mia issues a departmental policy stating that the SoS will henceforth refuse all applications for solar and wind farms without exception. Ethan, who has invested heavily in developing a novel wind farm proposal, submits his application. The SoS refuses Ethan's application, explicitly citing the blanket policy as the sole reason for the refusal, without considering the unique economic or environmental merits of Ethan's project.
On which ground of illegality is Ethan most likely to succeed in challenging the decision by judicial review?
A. The decision constitutes a breach of the mandatory duty to give clear, adequate reasons.
B. The refusal is so unreasonable that it fails the rigorous Wednesbury test of irrationality.
C. The SoS has acted ultra vires 
D. The SoS has committed the error of fettering discretion 
E. The policy is legally invalid because it conflicts directly with the general spirit of the Energy Development Act 2024.
The correct option is D.
Explanation
Option D is correct. A public body with discretionary power must genuinely exercise that discretion and not allow itself to be unduly restricted by a rigid policy. By applying a blanket policy that stated she would "refuse all applications" and refusing Ethan's application without considering its individual merits, Mia has failed to exercise her statutory discretion lawfully, which is known as fettering discretion, a form of illegality in judicial review.
Option A is incorrect. While inadequate reasons can be a ground for review, the primary and more fundamental error here is the failure to properly exercise the discretion, not just the quality of the reasons.
Option B is incorrect. The Wednesbury test for irrationality is extremely difficult to meet. The clearer, more powerful ground is the specific procedural illegality of fettering discretion.
Option C is incorrect. The failure to take into account a relevant factor is a related ground, but the more precise description when a public body creates a self-imposed, rigid policy is fettering discretion.
Option E is incorrect. This claim is too vague. The specific legal defect is the failure to consider the merits of the individual case, not a general conflict with the 'spirit' of the Act.
Question 12  (BUSINESS LAW)
Leo and Sofia are partners in a successful marketing consultancy, operating under a verbal agreement and governed by the Partnership Act 1890. Leo buys a new high-specification laptop for £4,000 using funds from the joint partnership bank account. 
He uses the laptop solely for developing client presentations and invoicing for the firm, and he claims the purchase as an expense in the firm's accounts. When the partnership is dissolved following a disagreement, Leo insists the laptop is his personal property because the firm's name does not appear on the receipt and he retains physical possession of it.
Which statement best describes the ownership status of the laptop under the Partnership Act 1890?
A. The laptop is Leo's personal property because title to moveable goods is based on possession and the name on the receipt.
B. The laptop belongs to Leo, but he must account for its market value to the partnership upon dissolution.
C. The laptop is partnership property because it was bought with partnership money for the purpose of the partnership business.
D. The laptop is partnership property only if the verbal agreement explicitly stated all equipment purchased was to be jointly owned.
E. The laptop is partnership property only to the extent of the share Leo draws from the partnership upon dissolution.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Under s.21 of the Partnership Act 1890, property bought with money belonging to the firm is deemed to have been bought on account of the firm and is thus partnership property. The fact that the laptop was purchased with partnership funds from the joint account and used exclusively for the firm's business (as evidenced by its expense being claimed in the accounts) is conclusive evidence that it is a partnership asset, irrespective of who holds the receipt or possession.
Option A is incorrect. The rules for partnership property override common law principles of title for goods purchased for the firm's business.
Option B is incorrect. Since it is partnership property, it forms part of the final partnership assets to be realized and distributed on winding up; it is not simply a personal asset for which Leo owes an account.
Option D is incorrect. The Partnership Act 1890 provides a statutory presumption (s.21) that overrides the lack of an explicit verbal agreement to the contrary.
Option E is incorrect. The status of property is determined at the time of purchase and depends on the source of funds and intended use, not the ultimate distribution upon dissolution.
Question 13 (TORT)

For the past three years, the "Brew & Forge" craft brewery and blacksmith workshop has operated in a mixed-use urban area. Its operations produce constant low-frequency vibrations from machinery and a persistent, pungent smell of hops and burnt coal. Priya, who lives in the adjacent converted Victorian house, finds the vibrations cause cracks in her historic plasterwork and the smell prevents her from opening her windows in summer, severely reducing her enjoyment of her property. Priya and other neighbours have complained repeatedly to Brew & Forge's owner, who argues the business is vital for the local economy and operates within all its environmental permits. Priya has now decided to bring a claim in tort.
Is Priya likely to succeed in a claim for private nuisance?
A. Yes, because the interference is continuous and has caused physical damage to her property.
B. No, because the business operates with all necessary permits, providing a complete defence.
C. No, because the character of the area is mixed-use, and some level of disruption is to be expected.
D. Yes, but only if she can prove the owner acted with malice or intent to cause a nuisance.
E. No, because the interference relates only to personal discomfort, not physical damage.
Correct Answer: A.
Explanation: A is correct. Private nuisance protects against unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of land. Continuous vibrations causing physical damage (cracks) are a classic example of a substantial interference. While the area's character (C) is relevant to reasonableness, it is not an absolute bar, and physical damage strongly indicates an actionable nuisance. B is incorrect. Operating with permits is not an automatic defence to a common law nuisance claim. Option D is incorrect. Malice is not a necessary element. While some claims rely on personal discomfort, the presence of physical damage here strengthens the claim significantly, making E incorrect.
Question 14 (TORT)
A group of 200 protestors from the "Climate Action Collective" staged a slow-march demonstration along the entire length of the Cromwell Road, a major arterial route into central London. The protest lasted for five hours during the morning rush period, bringing all traffic to a complete standstill. Thousands of motorists were delayed. Among them was Felix, a self-employed courier, who missed three pre-booked, time-sensitive deliveries. As a result, he had to pay penalty fees under his contracts and lost a major client, causing significant financial loss.
Does Felix have a viable cause of action in public nuisance against the Climate Action Collective?
A. No, because the protest was an exercise of the right to peaceful assembly, which takes precedence.
B. Yes, because any unlawful obstruction of the highway is automatically an actionable public nuisance.
C. No, because Felix suffered the same type of general inconvenience and delay as all other road users.
D. Yes, but only if he can prove the protestors intended to cause him specific financial harm.
E. Yes, because he has suffered special damage over and above the general inconvenience suffered by the public.
Correct Answer: E.
Explanation: E is correct. An unreasonable obstruction of the highway is a public nuisance. To bring a private claim for damages, an individual must show "special damage" i.e. harm that is particular, substantial, and of a different kind from that suffered by the general public. Felix's specific, quantifiable financial losses likely meet this test. A (right to protest) is a relevant consideration but does not grant immunity from nuisance claims where the interference is unreasonable. 
B is incorrect; while an obstruction may be a public nuisance, individual actionable damage requires "special damage." C is incorrect. It is the defining reason why most affected individuals cannot sue; Felix must argue his losses are not the same.
D is incorrect; intent is not a necessary element for public nuisance.


Question 15 (LEGAL SERVICES)
Leo, a solicitor in a commercial property firm, is instructed by his Client, Ethan to complete the purchase of a warehouse for £500,000. Ethan provides the funds via a bank transfer from an account in a jurisdiction known for high financial secrecy. Ethan explains the funds came from a successful but undocumented overseas asset disposal. During the Know Your Client (KYC) checks, Leo notes that Ethan is overly anxious and can only provide heavily redacted, non-official documents regarding the source of funds. Leo suspects that the funds may originate from unlawful conduct but decides to proceed with the transaction to ensure the firm earns the substantial fee.
By proceeding with the transaction in these circumstances, which primary offence under has Leo most likely committed?
A.The offence of Tipping Off 
B.B. The offence of Concealing criminal property 
C.The offence of Failure to Disclose 
D. The offence of Prejudicing an Investigation 
E. The offence of Acquisition, Use or Possession of criminal property 
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. A solicitor in the regulated sector (which includes commercial property) commits the offence of Failure to Disclose (s.330 POCA) if they: (1) know or suspect (or have reasonable grounds to suspect) that another person is engaged in money laundering, and (2) fail to make an authorised disclosure (a Suspicious Activity Report or SAR) to the firm's MLRO or the National Crime Agency (NCA) as soon as practicable. Leo has a clear suspicion based on the client's anxiety and poor documentation but chooses to proceed without reporting.
Option A is incorrect. Tipping Off (s.333) is committed by making a disclosure that prejudices a money laundering investigation. Leo did not make a disclosure; he failed to do so.
Option B is incorrect. Concealing (s.327) is a primary offence committed by the client (Ethan) but could apply to the solicitor if they conduct the transaction knowing or suspecting it is criminal property. However, Failure to Disclose (s.330) is the specific and mandatory offence that arises for solicitors in the regulated sector when they form a suspicion.
Option D is incorrect. Prejudicing an investigation (s.342) is a specific offence relating to interfering with a disclosure already made or an investigation already underway. The failure here is the initial lack of disclosure to the MLRO.
Option E is incorrect. Acquisition, Use or Possession (s.329) applies when a person acquires criminal property. While the fee might be criminal property, the more pertinent and mandatory offence for a solicitor in this scenario is the Failure to Disclose their suspicion.
Question 16 (TORT)
David owns a commercial storage unit where he keeps large quantities of specialized industrial cleaning fluids in a residential location. David takes all reasonable precautions to maintain the integrity of the storage containers. However, a sudden, exceptionally heavy rainstorm, the heaviest recorded in 50 years, causes a drain blockage, resulting in the overflow and mixing of the fluids. 

The mixed toxic fluid escapes and seeps into the foundations of Liam's house, causing significant structural damage. Liam is considering suing David for the damage.

Which element of the Rule in Rylands v Fletcher is David most likely to successfully rely on as a defence?
A. The use of the land was not truly non-natural as it was commercial storage.
B. The damage was not reasonably foreseeable by a reasonable man.
C. The escape was caused by the unforeseeable act of a third party.
D. The escape was due to an Act of God, specifically the exceptional rainfall.
E. The rule is limited to physical personal injury, not structural property damage.
The correct option is D.

Explanation
Option D is correct. The Rule in Rylands v Fletcher imposes strict liability for the escape of a dangerous thing from a non-natural user of land. However, this liability is defeated by the defence of Act of God, which applies where the escape is caused by natural forces that are so extraordinary and unforeseeable that no human foresight could reasonably be expected to anticipate or guard against them. The "heaviest recorded rainstorm in 50 years" meets this high threshold.
Option A is incorrect. Storing large quantities of industrial chemicals in a residential area is typically classed as a non-natural use of land, even for commercial purposes.Option B is incorrect. 
Option C is incorrect. The cause was the storm (a natural force), not the deliberate or negligent act of an external human third party, which is a different defence.
Option E is incorrect. The rule primarily applies to damage to land, property, or fixtures, not generally to personal injury. Structural damage is a classic head of claim.

Question 17  (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

Grace Ltd, a Claimant, issues proceedings against Daniel for breach of contract. Grace Ltd is an active company but recently filed its last annual accounts late, showing minimal liquid assets and a significant contingent liability related to an unrelated claim. Daniel believes that if Grace Ltd loses the current claim, it will be unable to pay Daniel's costs due to its financial situation. Daniel is considering making an application for security for costs against Grace Ltd .

Which of the following is the essential condition Daniel must satisfy to ground the application?

A. That the claim has no real prospect of success, justifying the immediate strike-out.
B. That the Claimant is resident out of the jurisdiction, or is a nominal claimant.
C. That there is reason to believe the company will be unable to pay the defendant's costs.
D. That the company's financial status is directly attributable to Daniel's own conduct.
E. That the Claimant is a limited company which failed to comply with any rule of court.
The correct option is C.

Explanation
Option C is correct. The most relevant ground for seeking security for costs against a limited company is found in CPR 25.13(2)(c), which allows the court to make an order if the claimant is a corporation and there is reason to believe that it will be unable to pay the defendant’s costs if ordered to do so. Grace Ltd's recent late filing, low assets, and significant liability provide this reason to believe.
Option A is incorrect. This is the test for summary judgment (CPR 24), which is distinct from an application for security for costs.
Option B is incorrect. Being resident out of jurisdiction is a valid ground (CPR 25.13(2)(a)), but the primary ground for a domestic, financially struggling company is (c).
Option D is incorrect. While the court considers whether the defendant's conduct contributed to the claimant's financial state, it is not an essential condition for grounding the application.
Option E is incorrect. Failure to comply with a rule of court is a separate ground (CPR 25.13(2)(e)), but the poor financial status is a distinct and more fundamental ground (CPR 25.13(2)(c)).

Question 18 (CONTRACT  LAW)
Liam contracts to refurbish Maya's commercial kitchen for £50,000, with a completion deadline of 1st July. Halfway through the work, Liam realizes he significantly under-priced the job and will lose £10,000 because he needs more workers to finish the project by the 1st July. Liam informs Maya he cannot complete by 1st July unless she agrees to pay him an extra £5,000 immediately to cover his rising labour costs in hiring more hands.

Maya urgently needs the kitchen completed on time to avoid triggering a penalty clause in her lease agreement. Maya promises to pay the extra £5,000, which results in Liam completing on time. Maya now refuses to pay the extra £5,000, arguing there was no consideration for her promise.

Is Maya's promise to pay the extra £5,000 legally enforceable?

A. No, because Liam only performed an existing contractual duty, which cannot constitute valid consideration.
B. Yes, because the extra £5,000 was a practical benefit to Maya
C. No, because Maya's promise was made under duress and is therefore voidable at her option.
D. Yes, but only if the agreement was documented in a deed, thereby avoiding the need for consideration.
E. Yes, because the extra £5,000 was a reasonable benefit to Maya
The correct option is B.

Explanation

Option B is correct. Although Liam was only performing an existing contractual duty, the principle established in Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd applies. Maya obtained a practical benefit from her promise (avoiding the penalty clause in her lease and securing timely completion). Provided there was no duress, this practical benefit constitutes sufficient consideration to make Maya's promise to pay the extra £5,000 legally enforceable.
Option A is incorrect. This reflects the general rule from Stilk v Myrick but ignores the crucial exception introduced by Williams v Roffey regarding 'practical benefit'.
Option C is incorrect. While duress can invalidate the promise, the scenario does not contain facts supporting economic duress (e.g., coercion or illegitimate pressure); Maya simply made a commercial decision to gain a practical benefit.
Option D is incorrect. Although a promise in a deed is enforceable without consideration, this is not the mechanism by which the promise in the scenario becomes enforceable; the applicable rule is the practical benefit test.
Option E is incorrect. It is practical benefit not reasonable benefit

Question 19 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS) 

Mia, a solicitor in a family law firm, receives £3,000 from her client, Chloe. The £3,000 is intended to cover two specific expenses: £1,000 for the Barrister's fee (a disbursement to be paid on Chloe's behalf) and £2,000 as an advance on Mia's own anticipated legal fees for preparation and correspondence. Mia's firm bills its clients monthly, and the £2,000 fee has not yet been incurred or billed. Mia follows the SRA Accounts Rules regarding money received from clients.

Which of the following describes the correct minimum action Mia must take regarding the £3,000?
A. Mia must hold all £3,000 in the firm's office account, provided it is covered by a valid invoice.
B. Mia must pay the £1,000 into the client account and the £2,000 into the office account.
C. Mia must hold the entire £3,000 in the client account until the fees are incurred and the disbursement is paid.
D. Mia must immediately return the entire £3,000 to Chloe, as the fees are not yet due.
E. Mia must hold the £1,000 in the office account and the £2,000 in the client account.

The correct option is C.

Explanation
Option C is correct. Under SRA Accounts Rule 2.1, all money held or received for a client must be paid into a client account. This includes:

Money held for disbursements (like the Barrister's fee of £1,000).


Money received in advance of costs not yet incurred or billed (like the £2,000 advance on fees). Therefore, the entire £3,000 is client money and must be held in the client account until the £2,000 fee is properly billed, and the £1,000 disbursement is paid.

Option A is incorrect. Money for costs not yet billed or for disbursements is defined as client money and cannot be held in the firm's office account.
Option B is incorrect. Both the disbursement money (£1,000) and the unbilled advance fees (£2,000) constitute client money under the SRA Rules and must be held in the client account.
Option D is incorrect. The solicitor is entitled to hold the money on behalf of the client for anticipated work/disbursements.
Option E is incorrect. Both components of the money are incorrectly allocated; both amounts are client money.




Question 20 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)

Ethan, the Prime Minister, issues a directive banning all public assemblies and protests within one mile of the Houses of Parliament for a period of six months, citing an urgent and unspecified threat to national security. When challenged, the government states that the directive is justified by the residual common law powers of the Executive and does not require explicit parliamentary authorisation. No statutory power exists granting the Executive the authority to unilaterally restrict public assembly rights to this extent. A judicial review is brought against the Executive's action.

Which core constitutional principle is most fundamentally offended by the Executive’s action in issuing this directive?
A.The principle of Checks and Balances 
B. The principle of the Separation of Powers
C.The principle of the Rule of Law
D.The principle of Ministerial Responsibility
E.The principle of the Independence of the Judiciary

The correct option is C.

Explanation
Option C is correct. The Rule of Law, as articulated by A.V. Dicey, requires that the state and its Executive must act only on the authority of the law (legality). If the Executive (the Prime Minister) issues a directive that restricts fundamental rights (public assembly) without a clear, explicit statutory or common law power to do so, they are acting outside the law. This breach of the requirement that the government must be able to justify every act by reference to law is a direct contravention of the Rule of Law. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.

Option B is incorrect. The action involves the Executive encroaching on civil liberties and the legislature's domain, but the Rule of Law is the more fundamental principle governing the Executive's need for legal authority.
Option D is incorrect. Ministerial Responsibility is a convention concerning accountability to Parliament, which is not the primary legal issue here.
Option E is incorrect. While the directive impacts rights which the judiciary protects, the constitutional error lies with the Executive's lack of legal power to issue the order, which is a matter of the Rule of Law.

Question 21 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
James is a partner at a firm specializing in commercial lease disputes. He enters into an agreement with "London Office Solutions Ltd" (LOS), a company that advises businesses on finding commercial premises. The agreement states that LOS will include a banner advertisement for James's firm on its client portal. In return, James's firm will pay LOS a fee of £750 each time a business client clicks on the advertisement and subsequently instructs the firm after a consultation.
 James ensures the advertisement is clearly marked as "Marketing Partner" and includes a standard disclaimer that "Fees may be payable for marketing services." He does not, however, explicitly inform each individual client about the specific payment structure with LOS.
Is James's firm in breach of the SRA Code of Conduct regarding this arrangement?
A. No, because the payment is a legitimate marketing expense for advertisement space, not a referral fee.
B. Yes, because any payment connected to the instruction of a client is a prohibited referral fee requiring specific client disclosure.
C. No, because the payment is made to a commercial entity for advertising, and a general disclaimer has been provided.
D. Yes, because the 'pay-per-click' fee structure is effectively a disguised referral fee that requires direct disclosure to the prospective client.
E. No, because the rules on referral fees do not apply to business-to-commercial-client relationships.
Correct Answer: D.
Explanation: D is correct. The SRA requires transparency where a third party is paid in connection with a referral. A payment triggered directly by a successful instruction (a "contingent" fee) is likely to be viewed as a referral fee in substance, regardless of it being labelled a marketing cost. The Code (para 5.1(d)) requires the client to be informed of any referral arrangement and the fee before or at the time of referral. A general disclaimer is insufficient to meet this specific disclosure obligation. A and C are incorrect because the substance of the payment (contingent on instruction) dictates its classification, not its label. B is incorrect. It is too broad, as not all connected payments are prohibited, but they do require proper disclosure. E is incorrect; the SRA's transparency requirements apply irrespective of whether the client is a business or an individual consumer.

Question 22 (BUSINESS LAW)
James and Chloe are directors of BuildFast Ltd, a construction company. In January, the company's accountant informs them that the company is technically insolvent, with liabilities significantly exceeding assets. Despite this advice, James and Chloe continue to trade aggressively, taking out a large, new credit agreement for raw materials from a supplier, believing that a single large, pending contract will save the company. 
The large contract falls through in March, and BuildFast Ltd goes into liquidation, owing the supplier substantial funds. The liquidator intends to pursue both James and Chloe for recovery.
Which liability is the liquidator most likely to successfully claim against James and Chloe?
A.Breach of the duty to promote the success of the company.
B. Fraudulent trading.
C. Wrongful trading.
D. Misfeasance.
E. Breach of the duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Wrongful trading (s.214 Insolvency Act 1986) occurs when a company goes into insolvent liquidation and a director knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid insolvent liquidation, but continued to trade. James and Chloe's decision to continue trading and incur new debt after receiving formal advice of insolvency directly falls under this provision. The court can make an order requiring them to contribute to the company's assets.
Option A is incorrect. While s.172 requires consideration of creditors' interests upon insolvency, wrongful trading is the specific statutory mechanism used by a liquidator to recover losses caused by continued trading.
Option B is incorrect. Fraudulent trading (s.213) requires proof of an intention to defraud creditors, which is a higher burden. While their actions were reckless, they believed the contract would save the company.
Option D is incorrect. Misfeasance (s.212) is a summary remedy for breach of fiduciary duties (e.g., s.172, s.173) or a breach of trust, but it is not the primary mechanism for recovering losses due to insolvent trading.
Option E is incorrect. While they may have breached s.174, the specific, heavier liability for trading while insolvent is found in the Insolvency Act 1986.
Question 23 (CONTRACT)
Aidan contracts with Olivia, a specialist software engineer, for a bespoke customer relationship management (CRM) system for £200,000, due for delivery on 1st November. Aidan intended to use the system to launch a new, highly lucrative business venture on 1st December, estimating guaranteed profits of £50,000 in the first month.
Olivia breaches the contract and delivers a wholly unusable system on 1st November. Aidan attempts to mitigate his loss but cannot find another engineer to build a replacement system until 1st January. Aidan sues Olivia for the breach.
Which of the following represents the most likely head of damages that Aidan will successfully recover from Olivia?
A. The wasted expenditure Aidan incurred on marketing his new venture, as this is reliance loss.
B. The guaranteed £50,000 profit for the first month, as this is expectation loss.
C. The loss of £50,000 profit for the first month, provided this loss was reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach.
D. The entire contract price of £200,000, as this is the cost of the wholly unusable system.
E. Punitive damages, because Olivia's breach was wilful and the system was wholly unusable.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Under the rule in Hadley v Baxendale, damages for breach of contract seek to put the claimant in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed (expectation loss). Loss of profit is recoverable if it falls under one of two limbs: (1) arising naturally from the breach; or (2) being reasonably contemplated by both parties, at the time the contract was made, as the probable result of the breach. Because the loss is a consequence of Aidan's specific business venture, the £50,000 loss of profit is recoverable only if it was reasonably foreseeable (contemplated) by Olivia.
Option A is incorrect. Aidan may recover reliance loss, but expectation loss (loss of profit) is generally preferred if it can be quantified.
Option B is incorrect. The loss is not guaranteed to be recovered; it is subject to the foreseeability rule.
Option D is incorrect. Aidan would recover the £200,000 he paid if he rejected the system and recovered the money as restitution, but he would also be entitled to the loss of profit suffered during the delay, provided it was foreseeable.
Option E is incorrect. Punitive (exemplary) damages are generally not available in English contract law, regardless of the wilfulness of the breach.

Question 24 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
Emily is instructed by a manufacturer to draft a long-term supply contract with a distributor, and her retainer outlines fees and the general scope of her legal work. Several days later, the distributor independently contacts her to advise on the same contract from its perspective. Believing both parties to be cooperative, Emily accepts the second instruction. As negotiations progress, the manufacturer instructs her to include minimum purchase obligations, while the distributor instructs her to resist such obligations. Emily attempts to maintain neutrality but finds her drafting choices increasingly favouring one side or the other. She becomes concerned that she cannot advocate each party’s commercial objectives independently. When discussions become tense, both clients learn she has been acting for the other. 
What should Emily have done in this instance?
A. Decline to act for both clients unless they gave informed consent 
B. Continue acting because both parties initially appeared cooperative.
C. Prepare two different drafts reflecting each party’s instructions without disclosure.
D. Proceed for the manufacturer only because it instructed her first.
E. Inform only the distributor because it faced greater risk.
The correct option is A.
Explanation
The SRA Code of Conduct for Solicitors prohibits acting for clients with competing interests unless fully informed consent is obtained and stringent criteria are met, consistent with reasoning in Hilton v Barker Booth and Eastwood. Emily’s duty of independent judgement was compromised because she could not advance both clients’ positions simultaneously. She should have disclosed the conflict, sought informed consent, and declined joint representation if consent was not given.
Option B is incorrect because early cooperation does not negate the emergence of a conflict. A conflict arises from adverse instructions, not from the parties’ initial attitude. Continuing regardless undermines independence and loyalty. 
Option C is incorrect because drafting separate documents for opposing parties without disclosure would intensify the conflict and violate fairness. It would also mislead each party about her impartiality. 
Option D is incorrect because favouring the first client is arbitrary and breaches the duty to treat all clients fairly. It ignores the need to disclose the conflict and obtain informed consent. 
Option E is incorrect because disclosure must be made to all affected clients. Selective disclosure is impermissible and fails to remedy the conflict.

Question 25 (TORT)
Liam is driving his company’s bus and the brake suddenly develops a fault. Liam suffers a traumatic psychotic episode, causing him to lose control and collide with a school bus. Liam's wife, Sarah, arrives at the scene 30 minutes later, having been informed by police that Liam was involved. Sarah sees the wreckage and is told by a paramedic that her husband had been severely injured. 
Sarah suffers a severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis as a result of the shock. Sarah sues the bus company (Liam's employer) for failing to provide her husband with a bus in good condition, leading to her psychiatric harm.
Which criterion, if not met, is most likely to defeat Sarah’s claim as a secondary victim?
A. The bus company's breach of duty of care was the factual cause of Liam's accident.
B. The psychiatric injury suffered by Sarah was a foreseeable consequence of the bus company's negligence.
C. Sarah must have suffered a recognized psychiatric illness, which PTSD qualifies as.
D. Sarah must have perceived the immediate aftermath of the accident with her own unaided senses.
E. The relationship between Sarah (wife) and Liam (primary victim) must be one of close love and affection.
The correct option is D.
Explanation
Option D is correct. Sarah is a secondary victim. To recover damages, she must satisfy the strict control mechanisms established in Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police. One of these mechanisms is that the shock must be caused by seeing or hearing the accident or its immediate aftermath with her own unaided senses. Arriving 30 minutes later, being told what happened, and seeing only the wreckage after being notified by police typically fails this test of proximity in time and space, defeating the claim.
Option A is incorrect. Factual causation is necessary but is often easy to establish. The legal hurdles are the Alcock control mechanisms.
Option B is incorrect. While psychiatric injury must be foreseeable, the Alcock criteria determine who the law deems foreseeable.
Option C is incorrect. While PTSD is a recognized psychiatric illness, this criterion alone is insufficient; all Alcock criteria must be met.
Option E is incorrect. A spouse is presumed to have a relationship of close love and affection, so this criterion is easily met.
Question 26 (BUSINESS LAW)
David is the sole director and shareholder of StorageCo Ltd. David intends to sell his shares in StorageCo to a new buyer, Maria. Maria does not have sufficient funds to complete the purchase of the shares. To facilitate the sale, David, acting as the director of StorageCo, proposes that the company provide Maria with a loan of £100,000 from the company's surplus funds to cover part of the share price. The board of StorageCo (David) approves the loan immediately prior to the transfer of David's shares to Maria. StorageCo is a private limited company and the loan is unsecured.

Which statement best describes the legal position of the loan under the Companies Act 2006?

A. The loan is voidable as it constitutes prohibited financial assistance for the acquisition of the company’s own shares.
B. The loan is valid only if the company passes a special resolution and the directors provide a solvency statement.
C. The loan is valid as financial assistance is no longer prohibited for private companies in the UK.
D. The loan is illegal, and David is liable for breach of his duty to promote the company's success (s.172).
E. The loan is valid as it does not exceed the lower threshold for a substantial property transaction.
The correct option is C.

Explanation
Option C is correct. The prohibition on a company giving financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares (s.678 and s.679 Companies Act 2006) was repealed for private companies in 2008. Therefore, StorageCo Ltd (a private company) is permitted to provide the loan to Maria to help her purchase David's shares, provided the loan is made in accordance with the directors' duties (e.g., s.172).
Option A is incorrect. This was the legal position for all companies before the repeal of the general prohibition for private companies.
Option B is incorrect. The special resolution/solvency statement procedure is the exception required for public companies to give financial assistance (s.680), not for private companies.
Option D is incorrect. The loan is not illegal under the financial assistance rules for a private company. A breach of s.172 would require proving the loan was not for the benefit of StorageCo, but the transaction itself is not automatically illegal.
Option E is incorrect. The substantial property transaction rules (s.190) relate to the acquisition of non-cash assets, not the provision of loans, making this rule irrelevant here.

Question 27 (TORT)
Chloe, a self-employed electrician, is hired by a homeowner, Ben, to fix a faulty wire in his attic. Chloe presented himself as the best electrician in the village. While carrying out the specialized work, Chloe suffers a serious electric shock because the wiring system was old, poorly labelled, and did not comply with current building regulations. Chloe sues Ben, the occupier, under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 , for breach of the common duty of care. 

Which of the following best describes the accurate position regarding Ben’s liability?

A. The common duty of care requires Ben to take reasonable steps to ensure the visitor is reasonably safe.
B. Ben is relieved of liability because the accident was caused by a latent defect which he could not reasonably have discovered.
C. The standard of care is heightened, requiring Ben to protect Chloe against all risks that are characteristic of her calling.
D. Chloe is deemed to have accepted the risk (volenti non fit injuria)
E. Ben can expect that Chloe, as an expert, will guard against and appreciate the risks ordinarily incident to her calling.

The correct option is E.

Explanation
Option E is correct. Under s.2(3)(b) OLA 1957, an occupier can expect that a person, in the exercise of their calling (e.g., Chloe the electrician), will guard against and appreciate any special risks ordinarily incident to it. Since faulty wiring and electric shocks are ordinary risks in electrical work, Ben can expect Chloe to take precautions against this risk. This expectation reduces the occupier's common duty of care.
Option A is incorrect. This ignores the modification of the common duty of care where the visitor is a professional.
Option B is incorrect. While Ben's lack of knowledge is relevant, the determinative factor is the professional status of the visitor, not the latent nature of the defect.
Option C is incorrect. The standard of care is generally lowered, not heightened, when dealing with specialized professionals, as the occupier can rely on their expertise.
Option D is incorrect. The defence of volenti (voluntary acceptance of risk) is unlikely to apply unless Chloe consciously accepted the specific risk of the poorly labelled system, which is hard to prove. The s.2(3)(b) principle is the more appropriate tool.

Question 28 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

TIm, a claimant, issues proceedings against James for breach of a commercial contract. The case is being managed on the multi-track. Tim's solicitor, Sarah, is preparing the standard disclosure list. Sarah knows of five emails between Tim and a previous supplier that significantly undermine Tim's claim regarding the market price of the goods, but these emails are not directly relevant to the specific breach of contract claim against James. Sarah removes these five emails from the disclosure list to protect Tim's case.

Is Sarah's action regarding the five emails consistent with the rules for Standard Disclosure?

A. Yes, because only documents that support the claimant's case are required to be included in the disclosure list.
B. No, because the five emails are documents on which Tim relies and therefore must be disclosed.
C. Yes, because the emails relate to a previous supplier and are not directly relevant to the issues in dispute with James.
D. No, because the five emails are documents that adversely affect Tim's case and must be disclosed.
E. No, because all documents in the possession of the party must be disclosed, regardless of their relevance to the dispute.
The correct option is D.

Explanation
Option D is correct. The definition of Standard Disclosure under CPR 31.6 requires a party to disclose documents:

Which they rely on;


Which adversely affect their own case;


Which adversely affect another party's case; or


Which support another party's case.

Since the five emails "significantly undermine Liam's claim" (i.e., adversely affect his case), they must be disclosed, even if they are not the primary documents supporting the claim. Sarah's action is in breach of the duty of disclosure.

Option A is incorrect. This ignores the mandatory requirement to disclose documents that adversely affect one's own case.
Option B is incorrect. While documents relied on must be disclosed, the obligation here stems from the documents adversely affecting the case, which is a different category.
Option C is incorrect. The test is not limited to documents directly relevant; it covers anything that adversely affects a party's case.
Option E is incorrect. This describes the much broader common law duty of disclosure, not the modern, limited test of Standard Disclosure under CPR 31.6.


Question 29 ( CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
The Prime Minister, exercising the royal prerogative, signed an international treaty (the "Oceanic Defence Pact") committing the UK to joint naval patrols in a contested strategic waterway. Following a change in government, the new Foreign Secretary made a statement to Parliament announcing the UK's immediate withdrawal from the Pact, citing overriding national security interests. 
The environmental NGO "Global Horizon" seeks judicial review of the decision to withdraw. It argues the government failed to conduct a mandatory statutory environmental impact assessment and that the withdrawal undermines international stability, contrary to its own published "Framework for Ethical Foreign Policy." The government argues the decision is non-justiciable.
Is the court most likely to find the challenge non-justiciable?
A. No, because the government must always follow its own published policies, making the decision reviewable.
B. Yes, because the decision was made under the prerogative and involves high-level treaty-making and national security.
C. No, because the failure to conduct a statutory environmental assessment is a clear point of law.
D. Yes, but only if the court is satisfied that the government's claim of national security is made in good faith.
E. No, because the decision has significant environmental implications, which are inherently justiciable.
Correct Answer: B.
Explanation: B is correct. Decisions involving the exercise of prerogative powers in the realms of treaty-making, defence, and national security are classically subject to non-justiciability. The courts treat such matters as unsuitable for judicial determination due to their political, high-policy, and sometimes secret nature. A is incorrect; while a legitimate expectation may arise from a published policy, it cannot fetter a prerogative power in such a sensitive area. C is incorrect; the core decision to withdraw is non-justiciable, and any peripheral statutory duty would likely be held not to constrain this core power. D misstates the law; good faith is not a threshold test for justiciability in this context. E is incorrect; while environmental issues are justiciable in many contexts, they do not override the non-justiciability of a core treaty and national security decision.


Question 30 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)

Maria, a solicitor, receives £100,000 of client money on behalf of her client, Chloe, to hold in a separate designated client account. The money is expected to be held for a period of two years pending the outcome of a complex contractual dispute. Maria's firm's policy states that interest is only paid on client money balances exceeding £5,000 that are held for more than three months. The firm's policy is reasonable given the likely costs of administering the accounts.
What is the firm's primary obligation regarding the interest earned on Chloe's £100,000 under the SRA Accounts Rules?
A. The firm must pay all interest earned on the designated client account to Chloe, regardless of the firm's policy.
B. The firm is not required to pay any interest to Chloe as the account balance is less than £150,000.
C. The firm must pay a just and fair amount of interest to Chloe if it is reasonable to expect interest to be earned.
D. The firm must pay interest to Chloe only if she formally requests it in writing at the outset of the retainer.
E. The firm can retain all the interest earned because its policy is reasonable and Chloe agreed to the retainer terms.
The correct option is A.

Explanation
Option A is correct. Under SRA Accounts Rule 7.1, if a solicitor holds client money in a separate designated client account (as Maria is doing here), the interest earned on that money belongs to the client (Chloe). The general rule allowing firms to adopt a policy for the payment of interest on general client accounts (Rule 7.2, where the firm can retain small amounts) does not apply to separate designated client accounts.
Option B is incorrect. The £150,000 threshold is irrelevant here; it relates to the requirement to hold professional indemnity insurance, not interest rules.
Option C is incorrect. This applies to money held in a general client account where the firm needs to justify why interest is or is not paid according to their policy (Rule 7.2).
Option D is incorrect. There is no requirement for a formal request for interest on a designated client account; the interest is automatically due to the client.
Option E is incorrect. The firm's policy is only relevant to money held in a general client account; it cannot be applied to retain interest from a separate designated client account.

Question 31 (Business law)

Sarah, a single woman, is employed and earns a salary of £45,000 per year. In the current tax year, she also receives a dividend of £5,000 from her private share portfolio. Her personal allowance is £12,570. The basic rate band for Income Tax extends up to £37,700 (taxable income). The basic dividend rate is 8.75% and the annual dividend allowance is £1,000. Sarah has not yet paid any tax on this dividend.

How much Income Tax, if any, should Sarah pay on the dividend she received?
A. She pays Income Tax at the basic dividend rate on the entire £5,000 dividend.
B. None, because her taxable income, including the dividend, remains within the basic rate band.
C. She pays Income Tax at the basic dividend rate on the proportion of the dividend that exceeds the annual dividend allowance.
D. She pays Income Tax at the higher dividend rate on the proportion of the dividend that exceeds her annual dividend allowance.
E. None, because the dividend was paid by a company which satisfies her liability by paying Corporation Tax.

The correct option is C.

Explanation
Option C is correct. Income Tax is calculated sequentially. Sarah's taxable salary is £45,000 - £12,570 = £32,430, which uses up part of the basic rate band (BRB) of £37,700. The remaining BRB is £5,270. Dividends are taxed only on the amount exceeding the annual dividend allowance of £1,000 (£5,000 - £1,000 = £4,000 taxable dividend). Since the £4,000 taxable dividend falls within the remaining BRB, it is taxed at the basic dividend tax rate of 8.75%.
Option A is incorrect. It fails to account for the £1,000 dividend allowance.
Option B is incorrect. Sarah's taxable salary (£32,430) uses most of the basic rate band (£37,700).
Option D is incorrect. Because the dividend falls within the remaining basic rate band (£5,270), the higher rate is not triggered.
Option E is incorrect. This reflects a superseded tax regime (tax credits); Corporation Tax does not satisfy the individual shareholder's liability.

Question 32 (Contract)

Liam, a commercial photographer, contracts with a supplier, ProLens Ltd, for the purchase of a new, high-specification digital camera for £15,000. Liam's contract is made on ProLens's standard written terms of business. 

Clause 7 of the contract states: "ProLens Ltd excludes all liability whatsoever for loss of profit or indirect or consequential losses arising from any breach of contract or negligence." 

ProLens breaches the contract by delivering a defective camera, causing Liam to lose a highly profitable £10,000 contract with a client. Liam sues ProLens for the £10,000 loss of profit.

Under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (UCTA), what must ProLens Ltd demonstrate for Clause 7 to be enforceable against Liam?

A.That the clause was legally enforceable.
B. That the exclusion clause satisfies the test of reasonableness 
C. That the exclusion clause was explicitly brought to Liam's attention before the contract was signed.
D. That the clause is a limitation clause, which is treated more leniently than an exclusion clause.
E. That the exclusion clause satisfies the test of fairness

The correct option is B.

Explanation
Option B is correct. Since this is a commercial contract made on the supplier's standard written terms of business, s.3 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (UCTA) applies. Under s.3, any exclusion or restriction of liability for breach of contract is only enforceable if it satisfies the test of reasonableness set out in s.11 of UCTA.Therefore, option A and E are incorrect. 
Option C is incorrect. While drawing attention to the clause helps establish reasonableness, it is not the statutory requirement itself.
Option D is incorrect. The clause excludes all liability for loss of profit, making it an exclusion clause. Even limitation clauses must satisfy the reasonableness test under s.3.

Question 33 (Dispute resolution)
A claimant issues a claim in the County Court against a kitchen fitter for £19,500, alleging poor workmanship and breach of contract. The claim details issues with installation, electrical faults, and consequent damage to property. The defendant files a defence and counterclaims for £5,000, alleging unpaid balances and that the faults were due to the claimant's own specifications. The case is likely to require some expert evidence from a single joint expert regarding the electrical and installation standards. The court is now considering track allocation.
To which track should this case normally be allocated?
A. The Small Claims Track, because the total sum in dispute, including the counterclaim, is £24,500
B. The Fast Track, because the value of the claim is £19,500, 
C. The Multi-Track, because any case involving expert evidence and a counterclaim must be allocated to the multi-track due to its complexity.
D. The Small Claims Track, because the primary claim is for defective workmanship, which is a typical consumer dispute for this track.
E. The Multi-Track, because the value of the claim, when reasonably added to the value of the counterclaim, exceeds £25,000.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. Under CPR Part 26, the fast track is the normal track for any claim with a value of between £10,000 and £25,000, unless it is a personal injury claim with a value between £10,000 and £25,000 where the non-pecuniary damages are less than £1,000, or the court considers that there are other significant factors (such as exceptional complexity) making it unsuitable for the fast track. Here, the claim is £19,500. While it involves a counterclaim and will require some expert evidence, these factors are not so exceptional as to automatically displace the normal rule for a claim of this value. The case is therefore suitable for the fast track.
Option A is incorrect. The small claims track limit is £10,000 for most claims (including this type). The claim value of £19,500 is nearly double that limit and is therefore too high for the small claims track. The total value in dispute, including the counterclaim, is not the relevant criterion for initial allocation; the value of the claim itself is decisive, subject to complexity.
Option C is incorrect. The mere involvement of expert evidence and a counterclaim does not automatically confer multi-track status. Many fast-track cases involve a single joint expert. The court must consider whether the case requires a more complex management process. On these facts, the case does not appear to have the level of complexity, number of parties, or value (over £25,000) that would typically necessitate allocation to the multi-track.
Option D is incorrect. While consumer disputes are common in the small claims track, they are excluded if their value exceeds the £10,000 limit. The nature of the claim does not override the financial threshold.
Option E is incorrect. The court does not simply add the claim and counterclaim values together to determine the financial band for allocation. The starting point is the value of the claim itself. A £19,500 claim does not exceed the £25,000 threshold for the multi-track based on value alone. The counterclaim is a factor for the court to consider, but it does not, in this instance, push the case into the multi-track.




Question 34 (CONTRACT)
Olivia, a qualified investment advisor, is invited to speak at a well-attended public seminar on general financial planning strategies. During her presentation, while discussing sector analysis, she uses "TechStart PLC" as a hypothetical example of a company in the technology sector. She states, "Based on my professional review of their public filings, TechStart PLC appears to have a strong growth model." Sarah, an attendee unknown to Olivia, hears this and later decides to invest £50,000 of her personal savings in TechStart PLC. The company subsequently fails, and Sarah loses her investment.
Sarah now wishes to bring a claim against Olivia for negligent misstatement, arguing she relied on Olivia's professional opinion.
Which element is Sarah most likely to fail to establish for a duty of care in negligent misstatement to arise?
A. That Olivia possessed the special skill or expertise required for an advisor.
B. That Olivia's statement was a factual misrepresentation, not a mere opinion.
C. That there was sufficient proximity establishing a special relationship of reliance.
D. That the statement was made in a professional and official capacity.
E. That Sarah suffered actual quantifiable loss as a result of the statement.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The established test for a duty of care in negligent misstatement (Hedley Byrne v Heller and Caparo v Dickman) requires a "special relationship" of proximity. This typically exists where the advisor knows (or ought to know) that their statement will be relied upon by a specific party for a specific purpose. A general statement made to a large, anonymous public audience lacks the requisite close, direct connection or "proximity" between the speaker and any individual listener. Sarah was an unidentified member of the public, and Olivia's statement was not made for the specific purpose of guiding Sarah's personal investment.
Option A is incorrect. As a qualified investment advisor, Olivia would likely possess the relevant special skill.
Option B is potentially incorrect. While the statement contains an element of opinion, the claim of having conducted a "professional review" could be argued as a factual representation about the basis of her analysis. However, this is not the primary hurdle.
Option D is incorrect. Olivia was speaking in a professional capacity, but this alone does not create a duty of care to all listeners.
Option E is incorrect. The loss of £50,000 is a clear, quantifiable financial loss

Question 35 ( TORTS) 
Mr. Henderson, a senior partner at a city law firm, hosted a lavish Christmas party for his staff at his country estate. He provided ample free alcohol throughout the evening. Seeing that a junior solicitor, Chloe, was visibly and severely intoxicated, he personally took her car keys and told her he had arranged a taxi. Micheal, another colleague offers to take Chloe home but Mr Henderson insists that the taxi will be better. However, he became distracted by other guests and forgot to call the taxi. Believing her boss had sorted her transport, Chloe waited for over an hour before deciding to walk home. She fell into a ditch on the unlit country road and dies.

Does Mr Henderson owe Chloe a duty of care?

A. No, Mr. Henderson does not owe a duty. Chloe, as an adult, was responsible for her own consumption of alcohol and her subsequent decision to walk home.

B. No, Mr. Henderson does not owe a duty. The provision of alcohol at a social event does not create any legal responsibility for the welfare of guests after they leave.

C. Yes, Mr. Henderson owes a duty. His actions created a situation of reliance, imposing on him a duty of care.

D. No, Mr. Henderson does not owe a duty. His offer to help was a casual, good-hearted gesture in a social context and did not create a legally enforceable obligation.

E. Yes, Mr. Henderson owes a duty because he hosted the party.
C is the correct option.

Explanation

C is the correct option. The law recognises that a duty to act can arise where a person voluntarily assumes responsibility for another's safety. By taking the positive step of confiscating Chloe's car keys and explicitly telling her he would arrange a taxi, Mr. Henderson went beyond being a mere host. He created a special relationship where Chloe reasonably relied on his promise. This gave rise to a duty to perform that self-imposed task with reasonable care. His subsequent failure to call the taxi was a breach of this established duty.

A is incorrect. While adults are generally responsible for their own actions, the law can impose a duty on another person if they take positive steps that create a situation of reliance, as Mr. Henderson did here. Her decision to walk was made in reliance on his broken promise.

B is incorrect. This states the general rule correctly but ignores the crucial exception. While providing alcohol alone may not create a duty, Mr. Henderson's subsequent specific actions and assurances moved this situation out of the general rule and into an exception based on assumption of responsibility.

D is incorrect. The context of a social event does not automatically negate a duty of care. When a person undertakes a specific task that another person relies upon for their safety, a legal duty can arise regardless of the social setting. The key is the reasonable reliance created by the specific promise and action.

E is incorrect. An employer's duty, even at a work-related social function, is not absolute and does not automatically extend to guaranteeing an employee's safe journey home. The duty here arises from the specific assumption of responsibility, not from the employer-employee relationship alone.

Question 36 (Contract)

David agrees to purchase a rare antique grandfather clock from John for £5,000. Both David and John genuinely believe the clock is a genuine early 18th-century piece crafted by a renowned London clockmaker, based on the signature on the clock face. The price agreed (£5,000) reflects this belief. 

After the contract is concluded but before delivery, an independent valuation reveals that the clock is a high-quality 19th-century replica, meaning its true market value is only £500. David is seeking to have the contract set aside on the basis of mistake.

On which ground is David most likely to successfully argue that the contract should be void at common law?
A.Factual mistake 
B. Satisfactory Quality
C.Mutual mistake
D.Misrepresentation.
E. Common mistake

The correct option is E.

Explanation
Option E is correct. This is an example of a Common Mistake, where both parties share the same mistake about a fact forming the basis of the contract. For the contract to be void at common law, the mistake must render the subject matter fundamentally different from what the parties believed they were contracting for (Bell v Lever Bros Ltd). A genuine 18th-century piece and a 19th-century replica, valued at £5,000 versus £500, represent a fundamental difference in quality that likely goes to the root of the contract, making it void (Leaf v International Galleries distinguished on facts).
Therefore, A, B, C, and D are incorrect. 

Question 37 ( BUSINESS LAW )

Chloe, Daniel, and Ethan are the three directors of Apex Tech Ltd, a private company that has adopted the unamended Model Articles for Private Companies. The Articles state that the quorum for a board meeting is two directors. Chloe and Daniel attend a board meeting to pass a resolution authorizing the purchase of a new office building. Daniel has a personal interest in the transaction, as the property is owned by a company in which he holds 70% of the shares. 

Assuming the MAs are unamended, what is the effective quorum for passing the resolution?

A. The quorum is two directors, regardless of whether any director is interested in the transaction.
B. The quorum is reduced to zero, requiring the shareholders to pass an ordinary resolution instead.
C. The quorum is one director, as long as the interested director is present at the meeting.
D. The quorum is one director, being the number of directors remaining after Daniel's interested vote is excluded.
E. The quorum is two directors, but only those directors without a conflict of interest may count towards the quorum.

The correct option is E.

Explanation
Option E is correct. Under the Model Articles for Private Companies (MA 14), a director who has a personal interest in a proposed transaction (Daniel) is not counted as participating in the decision-making process for the purposes of a quorum, even if they are present. Since the default quorum (MA 11) is two, and Daniel does not count, Chloe is the only director counting towards the quorum. Therefore, the minimum number of uninterested directors needed to form a quorum of two is two (Chloe plus one other uninterested director). Since only Chloe and Daniel were present, the effective quorum is not met.
Option A is incorrect. The interested director is present but cannot count towards the quorum for that vote (MA 14).
Option B is incorrect. The quorum is not reduced to zero; it remains two (MA 11).
Option C is incorrect. The quorum is set at two by the articles and is only modified by the exclusion of the interested director.
Option D is incorrect. The quorum is not reduced to the number of non-interested directors present; the original quorum of two disinterested directors is still required.

Question 38 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

Liam is a District Judge sitting in the County Court, hearing a personal injury claim brought by Daniel. Daniel's solicitor argues that a specific precedent set by a two-judge panel of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) should not be followed because it is clearly unjust and was based on flawed reasoning regarding the interpretation of a 2010 statute. Daniel's solicitor argues that a later, different precedent set by a single High Court Judge's decision on the same statute should be preferred.

Which rule of judicial precedent must the District Judge follow in this scenario?

A. The District Judge is bound by the Court of Appeal decision unless that decision was given per incuriam.
B. The District Judge is bound by the High Court decision, as it is later in time and more accurately interprets the statute.
C. The District Judge must follow the binding precedent of the Court of Appeal, regardless of the single High Court decision.
D. The District Judge must refer the conflict up to the Court of Appeal to resolve the conflicting precedents.
E. The District Judge is not strictly bound by either precedent and can decide the case on its merits.
The correct option is C.

Explanation

Option C is correct. The County Court (where the District Judge is sitting) is a lower court and is strictly bound by the decisions of all higher courts under the rule of Vertical Stare Decisis. The Court of Appeal (Civil Division) is a superior court to the High Court and County Court. Therefore, the District Judge must follow the binding precedent of the Court of Appeal, regardless of a subsequent, conflicting decision from a single High Court Judge.
Option A is incorrect. While the per incuriam rule is an exception, only the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court can typically apply it to their own prior decisions or those of lower courts. The District Judge cannot ignore the Court of Appeal's ratio decidendi.
Option B is incorrect. This reverses the hierarchy; the High Court decision is only persuasive, not binding, on the District Judge if it conflicts with a higher binding authority.
Option D is incorrect. The District Judge must apply the law as they find it, not refer the conflict upwards.
Option E is incorrect. The County Court is strictly bound by the higher appellate courts.

Question 39 (TORT)

John was operating a forklift truck in a warehouse when he negligently reversed into a shelf, causing a small box to fall and lightly graze his colleague, Miriam’s, arm. Unknown to anyone, Miriam had a very rare blood disorder that made her extremely vulnerable to bleeding, a condition not disclosed to her employer or colleagues. The minor graze triggered a severe haemorrhage, and Miriam required extensive hospital treatment, including multiple blood transfusions.

John had received standard forklift training but was momentarily distracted by a loud noise in the warehouse. The shelf was properly maintained, and the box was not improperly stored. No prior incidents of this nature had occurred in the warehouse.

 In a claim for negligence, which of the following statements are legally accurate?

a) John is only liable for the initial minor graze, as the severe haemorrhage was an unforeseeable consequence of his negligence.
b) John is liable for the full extent of Miriam’s injuries, including the severe haemorrhage
c) The standard of care owed by John was heightened because Miriam was a colleague, requiring him to be absolutely certain of her safety at all times.
d) The question of whether John breached his duty is assessed by considering the foreseeable consequences of being hit by a falling box.
e) John is not liable as he is not responsible for Miriam.
B is the correct option 

Explanation:
B is the correct option. This is a precise articulation of the ‘eggshell skull’ rule. The principle applies to physical and psychological susceptibilities, making the defendant responsible for the full damage flowing from their breach of duty 
A is incorrect. This statement directly contradicts the ‘eggshell skull’ rule, which is a fundamental principle of remoteness of damage. The defendant is liable for the full consequences, even if the claimant’s unusual vulnerability makes those consequences far more severe than could have been anticipated.
C is incorrect. The standard of care remains that of the reasonable person in the defendant’s position. While an employer owes non-delegable duties, between colleagues the standard is objective reasonableness, not absolute liability or a higher standard of certainty.
 D is incorrect. This statement is partially true for establishing breach (the standard of care is based on foreseeable risks) but is misleading for causation and damages. Once a breach is established and some damage is foreseeable, the eggshell skull rule applies to the quantification of damages for the full, unforeseeable extent of the injury. E is incorrect. 


Question 40 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
You are a solicitor in the corporate department of a small firm. Your firm has acted for Horizon Retail Group Limited, a company owned solely by Alexander, for twelve years on all corporate, employment, and property matters. Alexander now wishes to sell the entire issued share capital to Victoria, a former employee who has become a successful entrepreneur. The price is £5.7 million.
 Alexander instructs you to act for him and the company as seller. Victoria separately instructs your firm to act for her as buyer because she knows and trusts you from her employment. Both parties want the firm to act for both sides to save costs and speed the transaction. They describe the deal as friendly and fully agreed in heads of terms. 
From Alexander you learn of a valuable pending patent application that has not been disclosed to Victoria; he says it is irrelevant and she is already getting a bargain. From Victoria you learn she is proceeding only because Alexander assured her the company is debt-free, but you know from the company file that there is an undisclosed £800,000 director’s loan that Alexander intends to write off in his favour after completion.Both Alexander and Victoria confirm they are content for your firm to act for both sides and will sign any consent letter required.
What is the most appropriate course of action in this situation?
A. Act for both parties because they have given informed consent and the matter is substantially commercial.
B. Act for both parties, as the interests are substantially common in completing the transaction.
C. Decline to act for Victoria and continue acting only for Alexander and the company.
D. Decline to act for either party because a client conflict exists that cannot be cured by consent.
E. Act for both but implement an information barrier between the two sides of the transaction.
The correct option is D.
Explanation
The correct option is D because there is a clear client-client conflict under paragraph 6.2 of the Solicitors Regulation Authority Code of Conduct for Solicitors, Registered European Lawyers and Registered Foreign Lawyers 2019: you hold material confidential information from each side that is directly adverse to the other (the patent from the seller and the undisclosed loan from the buyer’s perspective). Acting for both would prevent you giving full and frank advice to one without breaching confidentiality owed to the other. The conflict is substantive, not merely confidentiality-based, and informed consent cannot cure a paragraph 6.2 conflict where duties are directly opposed (as established in Clark Boyce v Mouat [1994] 1 AC 428 and subsequent SRA guidance). You must decline to act for at least one, and in practice for both, to avoid being implicated in misleading either client.
Option A is incorrect because consent is ineffective where you cannot properly advise both clients without using one client’s confidential information against them; the conflict goes to the heart of your ability to act in each client’s best interests.
Option B is incorrect because the interests are not substantially common when each side is withholding material information that fundamentally affects the fairness of the transaction; the exception requires genuine commonality, which has ceased to exist.
Option C is incorrect because continuing for the seller while dropping the buyer (or vice versa) still leaves you unable to give proper advice to the remaining client without risk of using the dropped client’s confidential information or being constrained by it.
Option E is incorrect because information barriers only protect confidentiality; they do not cure the fundamental paragraph 6.2 prohibition on acting where there is a direct conflict of duty between clients.
Question 41 (BUSINESS LAW)
Zephyr Ltd's Articles of Association adopt Model Article 17. The board has 5 directors. Two long-serving directors, Ben and Chloe, are resistant to new strategic proposals. The other three directors wish to remove them to implement changes. A board meeting is called where a resolution is passed by 3 votes to 2 to remove Ben and Chloe from their office as directors.
Is the board's resolution to remove Ben and Chloe valid?
A. Yes, the directors can remove a fellow director by an ordinary resolution of the board.
B. Yes, provided the shareholders are notified within 14 days.
C. No, removal requires a ordinary resolution of the shareholders.
D. No, removal requires a special resolution of the shareholders.
E. No, unless the Articles expressly permit removal for a specific cause.
The correct option is C.
Explanation:
Option C is correct. Under s.168 of the Companies Act 2006, a company may by ordinary resolution of the shareholders remove a director before the expiration of their period of office, notwithstanding anything in its articles. The power of removal is vested in the shareholders. The Model Articles (and most standard articles) do not grant the board the power to remove a director; such power is reserved for the general meeting. The board's resolution is therefore invalid.
Option A is incorrect as the default legal position does not grant this power to the board.
Option B is incorrect; notification does not cure the lack of authority.
Option D is incorrect because an ordinary resolution, not a special resolution, is the statutory requirement.
Option E is incorrect; s.168 provides a statutory right of removal for shareholders, which cannot be negated by the articles, and no cause is required.
  
Question 42 (LEGAL SERVICES) 

Daniel, a solicitor in a high-street practice, is instructed by his client, Maria, to sell a property for £350,000. Maria insists on being paid the proceeds in cash, claiming she does not trust banks. Daniel informs Maria that the law prohibits large cash transactions. Maria then agrees to receive a bank transfer but becomes vague and evasive when asked for details regarding the ownership and history of the property she is selling. Daniel is unable to reconcile her explanation with the Land Registry data. Daniel now suspects Maria is engaged in money laundering.

What is Daniel's primary professional obligation under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002?
A. He must cease acting for Maria immediately and ensure he returns all documentation to her.
B. He must seek clarification from Maria; if still suspicious, he must refuse to proceed with the transaction.
C. He must make an authorised disclosure  to the firm's MLRO or the NCA as soon as is practicable.
D. He must warn Maria that he is legally obliged to report her to the National Crime Agency.
E. He must ensure that the transaction is only handled by the firm's Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO).
  
The correct option is C.

Explanation
Option C is correct. When a solicitor in the regulated sector (which property transactions fall under) knows or suspects that another person (Maria) is engaged in money laundering, they commit the offence of Failure to Disclose (POCA s.330) if they do not make an authorised disclosure (a Suspicious Activity Report or SAR) to the firm's MLRO or the National Crime Agency (NCA) as soon as is practicable.
Option A is incorrect. Ceasing to act is often necessary, but the primary and mandatory requirement is the SAR.
Option B is incorrect. Seeking clarification is part of the due diligence process, but once a definitive suspicion is formed, the mandatory reporting duty arises.
Option D is incorrect. Warning Maria would constitute the separate criminal offence of Tipping Off (POCA s.333), which Daniel must strictly avoid.
Option E is incorrect. The MLRO is responsible for the firm's policy, but the solicitor who forms the suspicion is responsible for making the report to the MLRO.


Question 43 (Contract) 

Chloe, who owns a vineyard, contracts with Ben, a transport specialist, to deliver a large consignment of fine wine from her vineyard in France to a high-end wine merchant in London by a specific date, which is known to both parties to be the date of a major launch event. The contract price is substantial. Before Ben can commence the journey, the English Channel is hit by a once-in-a-century catastrophic tidal surge, which completely destroys the port facilities in France that both parties had intended for the shipment. The earliest the port can be operational again is six months after the agreed delivery date.

What is the most likely legal consequence of the destruction of the port facilities on the contract between Chloe and Ben?

A. The contract is voidable at Chloe’s option due to a supervening illegality.
B. The contract is not discharged, as Ben assumed the risk of adverse weather conditions.
C. The contract is frustrated because performance has become radically different from what was contemplated.
D. The contract is frustrated because performance is delayed.
E. The contract is discharged by breach of a fundamental term by Ben, the carrier.

The correct option is C.

Explanation
Option C is correct. The doctrine of Frustration applies where a supervening event, occurring after the contract is formed, makes performance impossible or renders it radically different from what was originally contemplated by the parties (Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council). The destruction of the only intended port for a time period that makes the scheduled delivery impossible and defeats the commercial purpose (meeting the launch date) is a classic example of a frustrating event. The contract is automatically discharged.
Option A is incorrect. Supervening illegality is a specific type of frustration (e.g., war); the event here is physical impossibility.
Option B is incorrect. While commercial parties assume some risk, the "once-in-a-century catastrophic tidal surge" goes beyond normal commercial risk, preventing the application of the rule in Tsakiroglou & Co Ltd v Noblee Thorl GmbH.
Option D is incorrect. Frustration is not just because the performance has been delayed but because it is radically different from what the parties contemplated.
Option E is incorrect. Ben cannot be in breach because the event (the tidal surge) makes his performance legally impossible.

Question 44 (Business law)
"Bloom Ltd" has three equal shareholders who are also its only directors: Ava, Ben, and Chloe. The company's Articles of Association adopt the Model Articles. At a board meeting, Ava and Ben vote to appoint Ben's wife, Dana, as an additional director to help with an expanding workload. Chloe objects, believing Dana is unqualified. A resolution is passed by 2 votes to 1. Chloe claims the appointment is invalid.
Is the appointment of Dana as a director valid?
A. No, because the appointment of a new director requires a shareholders' resolution.
B. No, because Chloe, as a director, vetoed the appointment.
C. Yes, because the board can appoint directors under Model Article 17.
D. No, because all shareholders must agree to a new director appointment.
E. Yes, but only if Dana's appointment is ratified at the next AGM.
The correct option is C.
Explanation:
Option C is correct. Model Article 17 (Private Companies) states that "the directors may appoint a person who is willing to act to be a director." This is a standard power vested in the board. The appointment was made at a board meeting by a majority vote (2 to 1), which is procedurally correct. Chloe's objection does not invalidate the decision; she was simply outvoted.
Option A is incorrect. While shareholders can also appoint directors by ordinary resolution (Model Article 20), this does not preclude the board from using its separate, concurrent power of appointment under Article 17.
Option B is incorrect. There is no general veto power for individual directors unless specifically provided for in the Articles (e.g., a weighted voting right on this issue, which is not present here).
Option D is incorrect. Unanimous shareholder agreement is not required for a board appointment under the default articles.
Option E is incorrect. Board appointments under Article 17 are effective immediately and do not require subsequent shareholder ratification, though shareholders retain the ultimate power to remove by ordinary resolution.

Question 45 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)

Ethan, the Secretary of State for the Environment, has statutory power under the Coastal Development Act 2023 to compulsorily purchase private land "for the purpose of coastal erosion management." Ethan uses this power to compulsorily purchase a large area of private land owned by a company that is known to donate heavily to the opposition party. The real reason for the purchase is not erosion management, but to cause financial embarrassment to the company and to disrupt its ability to fund political rivals, which Ethan privately admits to his advisor.

On which ground of illegality is a judicial review of Ethan’s decision most likely to succeed?

A.The SOS failed to act with procedural fairness.
B. The decision is unreasonable .
C. The SOS has breached the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty.
D. The SOS has acted for an improper purpose
E. The decision constitutes a breach of the human right to property under the European Convention on Human Rights.

The correct option is D.

Explanation
Option D is correct. The statutory power granted to the SoS was "for the purpose of coastal erosion management." By admitting the real purpose was to cause financial embarrassment and disrupt political funding, the SoS is acting for an entirely different, unauthorized, or improper purpose. This is a fundamental ground of illegality in judicial review, as the public body must exercise its powers to promote the purposes for which they were conferred by Parliament.
Option A is incorrect. Procedural unfairness relates to things like the right to a hearing or a lack of reasons; the error here is substantive.
Option B is incorrect. The more specific and stronger ground of illegality is the misuse of power.
Option C is incorrect. While the SoS is acting against Parliament's intent, the specific legal ground for challenging the Executive's misuse of power is improper purpose.
Option E is incorrect. The decision may also breach the ECHR, but the direct and primary challenge to the Executive's legal power under domestic administrative law is the ground of improper purpose.

Question 46 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
Ben, a solicitor at a large national firm, previously acted for Daniel in an advisory capacity regarding a commercial property transaction, which has now concluded. Three months later, a different partner in Ben's firm is approached by Chloe, who seeks to instruct the firm to commence a high-value breach of contract claim against Daniel (the former client). The claim is completely unrelated to the property transaction, and Ben confirms that the firm holds no confidential information from the previous retainer that is relevant to Chloe's claim.

Which SRA principle primarily dictates whether Ben's firm can accept instructions from Chloe to act against Daniel?

A.The firm must refuse the instructions because a conflict of interest exists.
B.The firm may act for Chloe if both Daniel and Chloe provide informed written consent to the adverse instruction.
C.The firm must decline the instruction due to the risk of conflict.
D.D. The firm is allowed to act for Chloe provided the instructions relate to wholly different subject matter and no relevant confidential information is held.
E. The duty of confidentiality to Daniel is permanent and prohibits the firm from ever acting against him.
The correct option is D.

Explanation
Option D is correct. The scenario concerns a Successive Conflict (acting against a former client) under SRA Code of Conduct, Paragraph 6.5. This rule prohibits acting against a former client only if the solicitor holds confidential information which is relevant to the new matter and the use of which would be prejudicial to the former client. Since the question explicitly states the new matter is wholly unrelated and no relevant confidential information is held, the firm is allowed to act for Chloe against Daniel.
Option A is incorrect. A conflict does not arise merely because the firm is acting against a former client; the crucial factor is the existence of relevant confidential information.
Option B is incorrect. Consent is irrelevant in a successive conflict governed by SRA 6.5; the test is solely about relevant confidential information.
Option C is incorrect. SRA 6.2 refers to conflicts between current clients, not former clients.
Option E is incorrect. The duty of confidentiality is permanent, but the prohibition on acting only applies if the confidential information is relevant to the new matter.

Question 47 (BUSINESS LAW)
John  runs a business that is registered for VAT and uses the standard accounting method. In one tax quarter, John's business sells goods with a net (VAT exclusive) value of £80,000 to his customers. During the same quarter, the business purchases services and supplies with a net value of £30,000 from various VAT-registered suppliers. All sales and purchases are standard-rated at 20%. John is preparing his VAT return for the quarter.
What is the amount of VAT that Liam must pay to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) for this quarter?
A. £10,000
B. £16,000
C. £22,000
D. £110,000
E. £50,000

The correct option is A.

Explanation
Option A is correct. The VAT payable is calculated as Output VAT (VAT charged on sales) minus Input VAT (VAT incurred on purchases).

Output VAT (on sales): £80,000 x 20% = £16,000


Input VAT (on purchases): £30,000 x 20% = £6,000


VAT Payable to HMRC: £16,000 (Output) - £6,000 (Input) = £10,000

Option B is incorrect. This is the Output VAT only, ignoring the Input VAT reclaim.
Option C is incorrect. This represents the Output VAT plus the Input VAT.
Option D is incorrect. This is the total gross value of sales and purchases.
Option E is incorrect. This is the net difference between sales and purchases (£80k - £30k).

Question 48 (TORT)
Chloe runs a small manufacturing business in a mixed commercial/residential area. The machinery emits a constant, low-level humming noise and faint vibrations, but only during normal working hours (9 am - 5 pm). Liam, a resident whose house backs onto the factory, complains that the noise prevents him from enjoying his garden. Liam works from home and is particularly sensitive to noise. The noise level is not excessive for a mixed area, and Chloe has installed industry-standard noise reduction measures. Liam sues Chloe in private nuisance.

Which factor is most likely to defeat Liam's claim in private nuisance?
A. The defendant (Chloe) took reasonable precautions to reduce the noise and vibration.
B. The claimant (Liam) has an abnormal sensitivity to the noise, which the law disregards.
C. The duration and intensity of the interference is minimal, being only during working hours.
D. The nature of the locality is mixed commercial/residential, justifying the level of noise.
E. Chloe's manufacturing use benefits the public economy, making the interference reasonable.
The correct option is D.

Explanation
Option D is correct. In private nuisance, the court assesses whether the claimant has suffered an unlawful interference with the use or enjoyment of their land. The key factor for interference causing amenity loss (like noise) is the locality (Sturges v Bridgman). The law expects a higher level of tolerance in a mixed commercial/residential area than in a purely residential one. Since the noise is not excessive for a commercial area, the interference is likely deemed reasonable given the locality, defeating the claim.
Option A is incorrect. Taking reasonable precautions does not automatically defeat a nuisance claim if the interference remains unlawful (Cambridge Water Co v Eastern Counties Leather plc).
Option B is incorrect. While abnormal sensitivity is disregarded, the claim still fails on the primary ground that the interference is reasonable for the locality.
Option C is incorrect. Regular interference over a long period, even during working hours, can constitute nuisance if it is excessive for the locality.
Option E is incorrect. Public benefit is generally not a defence to a private nuisance claim, especially for noise (Adams v Ursell).

Question 49 (LEGAL  SYSTEM)
The Minister for Transport, David, is granted power by the Traffic Enforcement Act 2024 (the parent Act) to make regulations on the management and flow of traffic. David subsequently issues a Statutory Instrument (SI) that imposes a new, discretionary licensing fee on all heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) entering the UK, with the revenue being directed to general government funds. A group of hauliers challenge the validity of the SI, arguing it is an illegal exercise of power.
On which ground of judicial review is the hauliers' challenge to the Statutory Instrument most likely to succeed?

A. The Minister acted contrary to parliamentary sovereignty.
B. The SI is void because it is in conflict with a fundamental common law right of HGVs to use public roads.
C. The Minister has acted ultra vires by imposing a fee.
D. The SI is irrational 
E. The Minister acted illegally.

The correct option is C.

Explanation

Option C is correct. This is a case of substantive ultra vires. The power granted in the parent Act was for "management and flow of traffic." A general power to regulate does not implicitly grant the power to levy a tax or fee for general revenue purposes, as the imposition of taxes is generally a matter for the primary legislation itself. The Minister has gone beyond the scope and purpose of the parent Act.
Option A is incorrect. The fundamental error is the lack of authority for the content of the regulation.
Option B is incorrect. While common law rights exist, the more direct challenge is to the legal authority derived from the statute.
Option D is incorrect. Irrationality (Wednesbury) is difficult to prove. Acting ultra vires is a clearer ground here.

Question 50 (LEGAL SYSTEM)
A local authority bylaw prohibits "the riding or use of bicycles, scooters, skateboards, or other vehicles in the municipal park." Finn is fined for riding a motorised, self-balancing "hoverboard" (a single-wheeled electric personal transporter) in the park. He challenges the fine, arguing his hoverboard is not a "vehicle" within the meaning of the bylaw.
Which rule of interpretation is most relevant to determining whether the hoverboard is included?
A. The Literal Rule
B. The Mischief Rule
C. The Golden Rule
D. The Ejusdem Generis Rule
E. The Purposive Approach
The correct option is D.
Explanation:
Option D is correct. The ejusdem generis (of the same kind) rule applies where general words ("or other vehicles") follow a list of specific items ("bicycles, scooters, skateboards"). The rule presumes that the general words are limited to things of the same class or genus as the specific items listed. The court would need to identify the common characteristic of the listed items (likely, human-powered, wheeled recreational devices for personal mobility) to see if a motorised hoverboard shares that characteristic. This is the primary analytical tool for this drafting structure.

Option A is incorrect. While the Literal Rule considers the ordinary meaning of "vehicle," the presence of a specific list immediately before it triggers a more specific interpretive principle (ejusdem generis) that modifies the literal approach.
Option B is incorrect. The Mischief Rule is used to identify and remedy the defect in prior law that an Act was designed to correct. Here, we are interpreting a bylaw without a stated history of a specific "mischief," making ejusdem generis the more directly applicable rule.
Option C is incorrect. The Golden Rule is used to modify the literal meaning to avoid an absurd result. There is no suggestion of absurdity in this straightforward classification question.
Option E is incorrect. While the overall purpose of the bylaw (safety, tranquillity) is relevant, the ejusdem generis rule is the specific, established tool for interpreting this precise form of wording.



Question 51 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
You are a solicitor specialising in commercial property. Your firm acts for Regional Bank plc on secured lending. The bank is providing £4.2 million development finance to Apex Homes Limited, a company in which you own 25% of the shares through a family trust. You are not a director but receive substantial dividends. Your spouse Charlotte is the managing director of Apex Homes Limited. The loan is on arm’s-length terms with a first legal charge over the site. The bank’s instructions require you personally to draft the facility agreement and certificate of title because you have done similar work for them. 
You would personally benefit by over £300,000 if the loan proceeds because the development would complete your family’s retirement funding. The bank is unaware of your interest. Charlotte has her own solicitors. Your firm’s compliance officer becomes aware and says “it’s not a problem because the bank is sophisticated”. The facility agreement includes a clause requiring the borrower to pay the lender’s legal costs in full. You have previously introduced Apex Homes Limited to the bank as a potential borrower.
What is the correct position regarding your ability to act?
A. You may act because the bank is the client and Charlotte has separate representation.

B. You may act with the bank’s informed written consent.

C.You may not act because there is an own interest conflict 
D.You may act because the transaction is conveyancing in nature and no advocacy is involved.
E. You may act provided an information barrier is erected around you.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
The correct option is C because paragraph 6.1 of the Solicitors Regulation Authority Code of Conduct for Solicitors, Registered European Lawyers and Registered Foreign Lawyers 2019 creates an absolute prohibition where your own interest conflicts, or there is a significant risk it conflicts, with your duty to the client. Your substantial financial interest in the borrower receiving the loan creates a direct conflict with your duty to act in the bank’s best interests (for example, in advising on risk or enforcement). The conflict is own interest, not merely client-client, and such conflicts are not capable of being cured by disclosure and consent (as confirmed in Marks and Spencer plc v Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer [2004] EWCA Civ 1855 and SRA guidance). You must not act, and the firm should decline the instructions if your involvement is required.
Option A is incorrect because the existence of separate representation for the borrower does not remove your personal financial benefit from the transaction proceeding; the conflict remains with your duty to the bank.

Option B is incorrect because own interest conflicts are incapable of waiver by client consent under the SRA regime; the public interest in solicitor independence overrides private agreement.

Option D is incorrect because the nature of the work (conveyancing or otherwise) is irrelevant; paragraph 6.1 applies to all retainers where personal interest conflicts with client duty.
Option E is incorrect because information barriers cannot cure own interest conflicts; they are designed for confidentiality issues only.
Question 52 (LEGAL SERVICES)
You are a solicitor in a large national firm. Five years ago your corporate team acted for Summit Manufacturing Limited in its sale to Global Industries plc, during which the company disclosed highly sensitive pricing algorithms and customer margin data under strict confidentiality. The matter is long concluded. A partner in your litigation team is now instructed by a new client, Victoria, who wishes to bring a High Court breach of contract claim against Global Industries plc alleging defective supply of components causing £3.8 million loss. Victoria’s case would be significantly strengthened if she had access to Summit’s historic margin data, which reveals Global’s true cost base and undermines its defence on quantum. 
The data remains on your firm’s closed file and is highly confidential to Global as successor. The corporate partner who handled the original sale has left the firm. The litigation partner proposes to erect a formal information barrier so that no one on the litigation team can access the old file. Global Industries plc is not a current client of the firm but has used you occasionally for employment advice. Victoria is desperate for your firm to act because of your expertise in this technical area.
May your firm accept instructions from Victoria?
A. Yes, because the former client matter is concluded and an information barrier is in place.

B. Yes, provided Global Industries plc gives informed consent.

C. No, because there is a real risk of misuse of former client confidential information.

D. Yes, because five years have passed and the information is now stale.
E. No, but only if Global Industries plc is still a current client.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
The correct option is C because the House of Lords in Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG [1999] 2 AC 222 established that a firm must not act against a former client where it holds confidential information that is relevant to the new matter and there is a real (not fanciful) risk of disclosure, unless effective safeguards eliminate that risk. Here the pricing data is highly material and directly relevant to quantum; even with a barrier, the risk of inadvertent use or subconscious influence is significant in a national firm where institutional knowledge may remain. The SRA confirms in its guidance that barriers are insufficient where the information is “highly sensitive and central” to the new case. The firm must decline the new instructions.
Option A is incorrect because the passage of time and existence of a barrier do not eliminate the real risk when the information remains highly valuable and directly usable against the former client.

Option B is incorrect because consent cannot cure a former client confidentiality conflict involving highly sensitive information; the duty is to the former client, not waivable by them in these circumstances.

Option D is incorrect because the information remains confidential and relevant regardless of age; staleness is not a factor but not determinative when the data is still capable of use.
Option E is incorrect because the Bolkiah principle applies equally to former clients; current client status is not required.
Question 53 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
You are a solicitor acting jointly for brothers Daniel and Edward who own Premier Developments Limited 50/50 and are developing a site together. The company has a single asset: a development site with planning permission. Both brothers instruct you to draft a joint venture agreement and shareholders’ agreement that reflects their equal contribution and equal sharing of profits. They say they are fully aligned. 
Six months later the site value has risen substantially. Daniel contacts you privately and says Edward has become unreliable and he wants to buy Edward’s shares at the original valuation but without telling Edward the true current value, which is £1.2 million higher due to improved planning permission you obtained. Daniel asks you to prepare a share purchase agreement reflecting the lower price and to tell Edward it is simply updating the shareholders’ agreement. Daniel says “Edward trusts you completely and will sign anything you send”. Edward continues to believe you are acting jointly. Both remain clients on the file. The company articles require both shareholders to approve any share transfer.
What is the most appropriate course of action?
A. Continue acting for both because they originally had substantially common interest.

B. Continue acting for Daniel only and draft the agreement as requested.

C. Cease acting for both clients immediately.

D. Continue acting but inform Edward of Daniel’s plan to ensure transparency.
E. Continue acting with an information barrier and act only for Daniel.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
The correct option is C because once Daniel seeks to use you to deceive Edward about the value of the shares, a client-client conflict arises under paragraph 6.2 of the Solicitors Regulation Authority Code of Conduct for Solicitors, Registered European Lawyers and Registered Foreign Lawyers 2019. The substantially common interest exception ceases to apply when one client seeks a secret advantage over the other in the same transaction; continuing would involve you in conduct lacking integrity (Principle 5). You cannot prefer one client over the other or maintain confidentiality while providing proper advice to both. You must cease acting for both clients.
Option A is incorrect because the common interest exception only applies while the interests remain substantially common; once one client seeks to defraud the other, the exception falls away and paragraph 6.2 kicks in.

Option B is incorrect because preferring one client over the other in a joint retainer is prohibited and would involve you in fraudulent conduct.

Option D is incorrect because disclosure to Edward would breach confidentiality owed to Daniel without justification.
Option E is incorrect because information barriers do not cure a paragraph 6.2 client conflict involving directly opposed interests in the same matter.
Question 54 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
You are a solicitor in the commercial department. Your firm acts for two separate clients, Sophia and Thomas, who are unrelated property investors. Both wish to purchase the same commercial building in Birmingham that is being sold by auction with a guide price of £2.8 million. The seller has instructed a different firm. Sophia and Thomas each instruct you separately on the same day to bid on their behalf at the auction next week. 
Both are aware the other is interested because they have discussed it socially. Sophia says she is prepared to go to £4.1 million. Thomas to £3.9 million. Both say they are happy for your firm to act for both of them because “it saves auction fees and we trust you to be fair”. They are genuinely competing and have no collusion. The building is unique and neither will withdraw. Your firm has separate teams for each client.
May your firm act for both clients in the auction?
A. Yes, because the clients are competing openly for the same asset and have given consent.

B. Yes, because the matters are unrelated conveyancing transactions.

C. No, because informed consent cannot cure a same-asset conflict.

D. Yes, provided separate teams and information barriers can be used.
E. No, unless both clients agree in writing to waive confidentiality.
The correct option is A.
Explanation
The correct option is A because paragraph 6.2(b) of the Solicitors Regulation Authority Code of Conduct for Solicitors, Registered European Lawyers and Registered Foreign Lawyers 2019 expressly permits acting for two or more clients competing for the same asset where they are genuinely competing and have given informed consent in writing. Here the clients are openly competing at auction for the identical property, are aware of each other’s interest, and have expressly consented to dual representation. There is no confidentiality issue because neither has disclosed anything requiring protection from the other. The exception applies directly.
Option B is incorrect because while the matters are separate, the same-asset exception in paragraph 6.2(b) is the specific provision that permits dual representation with consent; it is not about whether the transactions are related.

Option C is incorrect because the SRA Code explicitly states that informed consent does cure this specific type of conflict when the competition is genuine.

Option D is incorrect because barriers are unnecessary when the exception applies and consent is given; the exception stands alone.
Option E is incorrect because the requirement is informed consent in writing, not waiver of confidentiality (which is not the issue here).
Question 55 (TORT)
A fire breaks out in a block of thirty-seven flats in the middle of the night. The local fire service, led by Captain Abigail, arrives and must rescue an elderly resident, Mr. Ephraim, from the fourth floor who is trapped by smoke in the building. The only available ladder on the appliance is slightly too short, without any other officials present at the scene and no response from the fire station when the captains calls for a longer ladder. 

This requires Mr. Ephraim to climb down the last few feet. Captain Abigail judges that waiting for a different appliance would be fatal. During the rescue, Mr. Ephraim, who is frail and disoriented, falls the short distance and is injured. Mr. Ephraim sues the fire service for negligence.

Is the fire service likely to be found in breach of its duty?

A. Yes, because the fire service failed to provide equipment that was adequate for all foreseeable rescue scenarios.
B. No, because the fire service was responding to an emergency and the social utility of saving lives justified accepting the risk.
C. Yes, because public bodies are held to a higher standard of care than private individuals.
D. No, because Mr. Ephraim voluntarily assumed the risk by agreeing to climb down the ladder.
E. Yes, because the burden of purchasing longer ladders was not disproportionate to the grave risk of injury.

B is the correct option 

Explanation
 B is the correct option. This reflects the principle from Watt v Hertfordshire County Council. The court will balance the risk against the end to be achieved. In an emergency where lives are at stake, a reasonable service may be justified in using imperfect equipment and accepting a higher level of risk than would be acceptable in a non-emergency context. 
A is incorrect. The duty is to take reasonable precautions, not to guarantee perfect safety with equipment for every conceivable situation. The court will consider what is practicable in the context of providing a public emergency service.
C is incorrect. Public bodies are generally held to the same objective standard of reasonableness as private entities. There is no automatic higher standard, though their specific functions are considered as part of the circumstances.
D is incorrect. The defence of volenti requires free and voluntary agreement to accept both the physical and legal risk. A resident being rescued from a fire is not acting voluntarily in a legal sense; they are likely acting under duress.
E is incorrect. While cost is a factor, the analysis is not purely financial. In the context of emergency services, the court recognises that it is unreasonable to expect them to have every piece of specialised equipment for every possible scenario immediately available. 

Question 56 (TORT)

Thirteen-year-old Caleb and his friend, also 13, are fencing with plastic rulers during a school break, pretending they are swords. This is a common game among their peers while running around the school premises. After the bell rang for the end of break, Caleb, trying to disarm his friend, flicks his ruler with excessive force. 

It snaps, and a sharp piece of plastic flies off and seriously injures his friend's eye which causes it to swell and after a visit to the doctor, it resulted in permanent damage causing him to rely on crutches for the rest of his life. The injured friend sues Caleb for negligence, but his mother argues that he is still a child who plays childish game. 

 What standard of care will be applied to Caleb?

A. The standard of a reasonable adult placed in the same situation.
B. The standard of a reasonable 13-year-old child with the same knowledge and experience.
C. The subjective standard of Caleb himself, taking into account his own level of maturity and foresight.
D. The standard of the school, as the accident happened on its premises during its care.
E. There is no standard, as children cannot be held liable in negligence for accidents during play.

B is the correct option 

Explanation

B is the correct option. This applies the principle from Mullin v Richards. The standard of care for a child is that of a reasonable child of the same age, intelligence, and experience. The court will consider what risks a typical 13-year-old would have foreseen in the circumstances of playing with plastic rulers.
A is incorrect. This would set an unrealistically high standard. The law recognises that children cannot be expected to demonstrate the same level of foresight and responsibility as adults.
C is incorrect. The standard remains objective, not subjective. It is not what this particular child (Caleb) could foresee, but what an ordinary, reasonable child of his age could be expected to foresee. The law aims for consistency within the peer group.
D is incorrect. While the school may potentially bear its own separate liability as an occupier or for failing to supervise, this does not extinguish the potential personal liability of Caleb. The two are not mutually exclusive.
E is incorrect. Children can be held liable in negligence. The law does not provide them with blanket immunity. The standard applied is simply adjusted to reflect their age and maturity.

Question 57 (TORT)

Tobias, a cyclist, is knocked off his bike by a careless driver, Isaac. The collision itself is minor. Tobias suffers a small, superficial cut to his leg. Unknown to Isaac, Tobias has a rare blood condition, Von Willebrand disease, which means his blood does not clot normally. The minor cut leads to persistent bleeding that cannot be easily stopped. Tobias requires multiple blood transfusions and extensive surgery, leaving him with a permanent disability.

The minor cut leads to persistent bleeding that cannot be easily stopped, requiring multiple blood transfusions and extensive surgery, leaving Tobias with a permanent disability that prevents him from cycling. Tobias was wearing a helmet and high-visibility clothing, and the road was dry and well-lit. Isaac was distracted by his phone at the time of the collision. 

Is Isaac liable for the full extent of Tobias's injuries?

A.No, because Isaac could not have reasonably foreseen that a minor collision would lead to such severe consequences.
B. Yes, because Isaac must take Tobias as he finds him
C. No, because Tobias had a duty to inform other road users of his special medical condition.
D. Yes, but only for the minor cut that was directly foreseeable, not for the complications arising from the blood condition.
E. No, because the extent of the injury was too remote from the original breach of duty.
B is the correct option 
Explanation
B is the correct option. This is a direct statement of the "eggshell skull" rule. Once a breach of duty that causes some injury is established, the defendant is liable for the full consequences of that injury, even if the claimant's unusual physical (or psychological) vulnerability makes those consequences far more severe than could have been anticipated.
A is incorrect. This is precisely the misconception that the "eggshell skull" rule is designed to counter. Foreseeability of the extent of the injury is not required.
C is incorrect. There is no legal duty for individuals to disclose their private medical conditions to the world at large. The entire responsibility for taking care rests on the person owing the duty of care.
D is incorrect. The law does not separate the initial injury from the exacerbating effects of a pre-existing condition. The defendant is liable for the entire damage that flows from their negligence.
E is incorrect. The "eggshell skull" rule is a key exception to the principles of remoteness. The type of harm (personal injury) was foreseeable; the extent of it does not make it too remote in law.

Question 58 (BUSINESS LAW)
Zara is a sole trader running a graphic design business. In the 2024/25 tax year, her business makes a taxable profit of £48,000. She also receives £2,000 in dividends from shares she holds in a listed company and £500 in interest from a business savings account. She has no other income.
What is Zara’s correct status for tax purposes on these different streams of income?
A. She will pay Income Tax on the dividend income and Corporation Tax on her trading profit and savings interest.
B. She will pay Income Tax on her trading profit and savings interest, and a separate Dividend Tax on her dividend income.
C. She will pay Corporation Tax on her trading profit and Income Tax on her savings and dividend income.
D. She will pay Income Tax on her trading profit and dividend income, but her savings interest will be tax-free.
E. She will pay Income Tax on all sources of income combined, with no distinction between them.
B is the correct option.
Explanation
B is correct. As a sole trader, Zara's trading profits are subject to Income Tax. Savings interest is also subject to Income Tax, but may be covered by allowances. Dividends are taxed under a separate regime (Dividend Tax) with its own allowance and rates. A sole trader is not a separate legal entity and therefore does not pay Corporation Tax.
A is incorrect because sole traders do not pay Corporation Tax; this tax is for companies.
C is incorrect for the same reason; Corporation Tax does not apply to sole traders.
D is incorrect because while some savings interest may be tax-free due to the Personal Savings Allowance, it is still classed as savings income for the tax calculation and is not automatically entirely tax-free.
E is incorrect because the UK tax system categorises income into different "slices" (non-savings, savings, dividends) which are taxed in a specific order and at different rates.

Question 59 (BUSINESS LAW)
Ben has run his own unincorporated bakery as a sole trader for 15 years. He sells the entire business as a going concern, realising a chargeable gain of £900,000 on the business assets. He has not used any Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR) before.
What is the rate of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) that Ben will pay on this gain?
A. 10%
B. 18%
C. 20%
D. 28%
E. 40%
A is the correct option.
Explanation
A is correct. The disposal of all or part of a business by a sole trader can qualify for Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR), provided all conditions are met (e.g., owning the business for at least 2 years). BADR applies a 10% CGT rate on qualifying gains, up to a lifetime limit of £1 million.
B is incorrect as 18% is the CGT rate for residential property (not main residence) for a basic rate taxpayer.
C is incorrect as 20% is the standard higher rate for CGT on most assets.
D is incorrect as 28% is the CGT rate for residential property (not main residence) for a higher rate taxpayer.
E is incorrect as 40% is an Income Tax rate, not a CGT rate.

Question 60 (BUSINESS LAW)

Christopher, Daniel, and Edward enthusiastically decided to start a graphic design business together. Eager to begin winning clients, they mutually agreed to "sort out the paperwork later" and focused immediately on operations. They secured a small office space and contributed different amounts to cover the initial setup costs and rent. Christopher invested £6,000 from his personal savings, Daniel contributed £3,000, and Edward provided £1,000. They operated for an entire year without any written agreement governing their relationship.

During this time, Christopher was responsible for bringing in the vast majority of the clients and consistently worked significantly longer hours than his colleagues. He naturally assumed that the eventual profits would be shared in a manner reflecting their unequal capital contributions and his greater work effort. When the business completed its first year and made a net profit of £30,000, Daniel and Edward insisted that the profits be split equally three ways. 

Under the default statutory rules, how will the profit of £30,000 be shared among Christopher, Daniel, and Edward?

A.The profit will be shared in proportion to the capital contributions of £6,000, £3,000, and £1,000 respectively.
B.The profit will be shared equally between the three partners.
C.The court will decide a fair division based on the actual work and effort contributed by each partner.
D.The profit cannot be distributed until a formal partnership agreement is signed by all parties.
E.Christopher is entitled to the entire profit because he brought in the clients and worked the hardest.

Explanation

B is the correct option. In the absence of a partnership agreement to the contrary, the default rule under Section 24(1) of the Partnership Act 1890 is that "all partners are entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the business." The statute imposes a presumption of equality, regardless of unequal capital contributions or disparities in work effort. Therefore, the £30,000 profit would be split into three equal shares of £10,000 for each partner.

A is incorrect because the default rule does not link profit-sharing to capital contribution. The statutory presumption is for an equal split, which can only be displaced by an express or implied agreement between the partners, which does not exist here.

C is incorrect as the court will not impose a "fair" division based on effort. In the absence of an agreement, the court will apply the clear statutory default rule of equal sharing as set out in the Partnership Act 1890. The subjective view of fairness of one partner is not a legal basis for distribution.

D is incorrect because the absence of a formal partnership agreement does not prevent profit distribution. On the contrary, it triggers the application of the default rules in the Partnership Act 1890, which provide a complete framework for operating the partnership, including the division of profits.

E is incorrect as the default rules do not award profits based on perceived merit or effort. While Christopher may feel this is unjust, the law provides a default mechanism that treats all partners as equals in the absence of their own specific agreement.

Question 61 (BUSINESS LAW)

Thomas, Richard, and Harold established a marketing consultancy, focusing entirely on client acquisition without drafting a formal partnership agreement. Thomas contributed £15,000 as start-up capital, Richard contributed £5,000, and Harold provided no capital but offered his valuable industry expertise and contact network. The business struggled significantly in its first year of operation, accumulating a substantial net loss of £24,000. 

Thomas, who considers himself the primary financier, has now been presented with an invoice from a key supplier for £18,000. The business lacks the funds to pay this debt. The supplier has explicitly indicated its intention to pursue Thomas personally for the full amount. Thomas is contesting this, arguing that the partnership's financial losses should be shared internally according to their initial capital contributions.

Based on the default statutory rules, what is Thomas's potential personal liability for the partnership's debts?

Options:
A.Thomas is liable only for a share of the debt proportionate to his capital contribution, meaning he would be liable for £9,000.
B.Thomas is jointly liable for the entire £18,000 debt, but he has a right to claim a contribution of £6,000 each from Richard and Harold.
C.Thomas is not personally liable for the debt as the invoice was issued to the business name and not to him individually.
D.Thomas is severally liable for the entire £18,000 debt, and his right to claim contributions from his partners depends on their ability to pay.
E.Thomas is liable only for one-third of the debt, £6,000, as losses are shared equally under the default rules.

Explanation

D is the correct option. Under the default rules of the Partnership Act 1890, partners have unlimited liability, which is both joint and several. This means a creditor can choose to sue any one partner for the entire debt. Thomas is therefore personally liable for the full £18,000. His right to claim contributions from Richard and Harold for their shares exists in theory, but it is a separate matter of indemnity that depends on his partners' financial solvency; if they cannot pay, Thomas bears the full loss.

A is incorrect because liability to a third-party creditor is not capped or apportioned by internal capital contributions. The principle of joint and several liability means each partner is fully liable for all partnership debts.

B is incorrect because it understates the nature of several liability. While Thomas is jointly liable, he is also severally liable, meaning the creditor is not obliged to sue all partners together but can recover the entire debt from Thomas alone. His right of indemnity is not a defence against the creditor.

C is incorrect as a partnership is not a separate legal entity. The debt is a partnership debt, for which all partners are personally liable regardless of the name on the invoice.

E is incorrect because while losses are shared equally between the partners internally, this internal sharing arrangement does not limit a partner's external liability to a creditor. The creditor's right to pursue any partner for the full debt is paramount.

Question 62 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
A journalist is prosecuted under a new National Security Act for refusing to disclose the identity of a whistleblower who leaked documents regarding government corruption. The journalist argues that the prosecution violates Article 10 (Freedom of Expression) of the ECHR. During the proceedings, the journalist’s legal team points to a recent judgment from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) that protected a journalist in a near-identical situation in France.
According to s.2 of the Human Rights Act 1998, how must the UK court treat this ECTHR judgment?
A.The court is strictly bound by the ECTHR judgment under the doctrine of stare decisis. 
B.The court must follow the ECTHR judgment unless it conflicts with a prior House of Lords decision. 
C.The court must take the ECTHR judgment into account but is not strictly bound by it. 
D. The court must ignore the judgment as it involved a different legal jurisdiction (France). 
E. The court must apply the judgment only if the UK government was a party to that specific case.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Under s.2 HRA 1998, a court determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must "take into account" any judgment, decision, or declaration of the European Court of Human Rights. As established in R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator, while UK courts usually follow clear and constant jurisprudence from Strasbourg, they are not strictly bound by it in the same way they are bound by domestic superior courts. 
Option A is incorrect. The ECtHR does not create binding precedent for UK courts in the same way the Supreme Court does. 
Option B is incorrect. While Kay v Lambeth suggests domestic precedent should be followed to maintain certainty, s.2 itself does not create a hierarchy where domestic law automatically overrides Strasbourg; it simply requires the court to "take into account" the latter. 
Option D is incorrect. s.2 specifically requires UK courts to consider ECtHR rulings regardless of which member state was the respondent in the original case. 
 Option E is incorrect. The duty to take ECtHR jurisprudence into account applies to all relevant case law, not just cases brought against the United Kingdom.

Question 63 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
The government introduces a new policy requiring all individuals working in the public health sector to provide a DNA sample to be kept on a permanent national database. The government argues this is necessary to ensure the integrity of the health service and to assist in any future criminal investigations involving hospital staff. A nurse, who has no criminal record, challenges this policy, arguing that the indefinite retention of her genetic data without any specific suspicion of wrongdoing is a violation of her rights.
Which Convention Right is the nurse most likely to rely on to challenge the permanent retention of her DNA sample?
A.Article 2 
B.Article 5 
C.Article 8 
D.Article 9 
E.Article 1 Protocol 1
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. Article 8 protects the right to respect for private and family life, home, and correspondence. The European Court of Human Rights (and UK courts following S and Marper v UK) has clearly established that the retention of biometric data (like DNA or fingerprints) constitutes an interference with private life. If the retention is permanent and applies to individuals not convicted of an offence, it is likely to be deemed disproportionate and a breach of Article 8. Option A is incorrect. Article 2 concerns the protection of life and state investigations into deaths; it is not relevant to data retention. 
Option B is incorrect. Article 5 protects against arbitrary physical detention (loss of liberty). Collecting a DNA sample does not constitute a deprivation of liberty.
 Option D is incorrect. Article 9 protects religious and philosophical beliefs. Unless the nurse argues the sample collection violates a specific religious tenet, Article 8 is the primary and most relevant right. 
Option E is incorrect. While biological samples are "property" in a literal sense, the legal challenge to state databases is handled under the privacy framework of Article 8 rather than the protection of possessions.


Question 64 (BUSINESS LAW)

Summit Trading Ltd" is a private company that has had a profitable year. Its most recent audited accounts show accumulated realised profits of £150,000. The directors are keen to reward the shareholders and propose to pay a dividend of £50,000. However, one of the directors notes that the company has an outstanding loan that requires the company to maintain a minimum level of net assets. 

The directors obtain an interim management account which shows that, after accounting for the proposed dividend, the company's net assets would fall below this covenant level. The directors decide to proceed with the dividend payment regardless, believing the covenant is overly restrictive and that the company's cash flow is strong. 

Based on the rules governing distributions, which of the following is a fundamental legal requirement for Summit Trading Ltd to lawfully pay the dividend?

A. The dividend must be paid only if it does not cause the company to breach its loan covenants.
B. The dividend must be justified by reference to the company's strong cash flow position.
C. The dividend must be paid out of accumulated realised profits.
D. The dividend must be approved by a special resolution of the shareholders.
E. The dividend must be paid only from the profits of the most recent financial year.

The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct because the fundamental rule under section 830 of the Companies Act 2006 is that a company may only make a distribution out of profits available for the purpose, which are its accumulated, realised profits (so far as not previously utilised by distribution or capitalisation) less its accumulated, realised losses (so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganisation of capital). The company's audited accounts show sufficient realised profits, which is the primary legal test.
Option A is incorrect because while breaching a loan covenant is a serious commercial issue with potential contractual consequences, it does not directly determine the lawfulness of a distribution under company law.
Option B is incorrect because cash flow is a commercial consideration, not the legal test for determining the legality of a distribution. A company can have strong cash flow but no distributable profits, and vice versa.
Option D is incorrect because a final dividend is declared by an ordinary resolution, but the fundamental legality of the distribution depends on the existence of distributable profits, not just shareholder approval.
Option E is incorrect because the test is cumulative; it is based on accumulated realised profits less accumulated realised losses, not just the profits of the most recent year.

Question 65 (BUSINESS LAW)

"Northern Manufacturing Co. Ltd" was experiencing rapid growth and needed to upgrade its machinery. To finance this, on the 1st of May, the company executed a debenture in favour of its long-standing bank, creating a fixed charge over its new, high-value industrial premises and a floating charge over its other assets.

 The company's finance director, who was responsible for legal filings, was unexpectedly hospitalised. Consequently, the task of registering the charge at Companies House was overlooked in the ensuing disruption. The company's junior administrator eventually filed the necessary Form MR01 on the 30th of May, which was 29 days after the charge's creation. 

Unfortunately, a key customer went into administration shortly after, causing a severe cash flow crisis for Northern Manufacturing, which led to it entering administration itself on the 15th of June. The administrator, upon reviewing the company's records, has identified the issue with the timing of the charge registration.

What is the legal consequence of the charge being registered outside the 21-day period prescribed by  Companies Act 2006?
A. The charge is void against the administrator and the company's creditors, leaving the bank as an unsecured lender.
B. The charge remains fully valid, but the company and its officers are liable to a financial penalty for the late filing.
C. The charge is void only against the administrator if they can prove they relied on the absence of the charge on the register.
D. The charge is valid because it was registered before the company entered administration, and the delay was minimal.
E. The charge is void only if it can be shown that a creditor provided new credit to the company in the period between day 21 and the date of actual registration.

The correct option is A.

Explanation
Option A is correct because section 859H of the Companies Act 2006 is explicit: if a registrable charge is not delivered to the registrar within 21 days of its creation, it is void against a liquidator, an administrator, and any creditor of the company. This voidness is automatic and is not dependent on the administrator or creditors proving they were misled or suffered prejudice.
Option B is incorrect because while a late filing penalty is a separate administrative consequence, the primary and severe legal consequence is the voidness of the security against the relevant parties.
Option C is incorrect because the statute does not require the administrator to prove reliance; the voidness occurs by operation of law upon the expiry of the 21-day period without registration.
Option D is incorrect because the critical date is the date of delivery to Companies House relative to the 21-day deadline from creation. Registration after this period is ineffective, regardless of when the company enters administration.
Option E is incorrect; the voidness is not conditional upon a subsequent creditor being disadvantaged. It is a blanket statutory provision designed to ensure the public register is accurate and timely.


Question 66 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)

David, a local community leader, is organising a march to celebrate the town's founding anniversary. The event is planned for Saturday, the 15th of the month. The march will begin at the town hall at 2:00 PM, proceed down the High Street, and conclude with speeches at the central park. David is keen to ensure the event is lawful and seeks advice on the legal requirements for notifying the authorities about the procession. He is unsure about the specific deadlines and the consequences of failing to adhere to them, wanting to avoid any unintentional illegality that could jeopardise the participants and the event's success.

 What is the statutory requirement under the Public Order Act 1986 regarding the advance notice that David must provide to the police for his planned procession?

●A. David must apply for a permit from the local authority at least 21 days before the procession.
●B. David must deliver written notice to a police station in the relevant area, and this must be done at least 6 clear days before the date of the procession.
●C. David is only required to inform the police on the day of the event, as long as he provides his name and address at the start of the march.
●D. David must deliver written notice to a police station in the relevant area, and this must be done at least 7 clear days before the date of the procession.
●E. David must publish his intentions in a local newspaper one week before the event, and this publication serves as sufficient notice to all relevant authorities, including the police.

The correct answer is option B

Explanation

Option B is correct. Section 11 of the Public Order Act 1986 imposes a clear legal duty on the organiser of a public procession to deliver written notice to a police station. This notice must include specific details such as the date, proposed start time, and the proposed route. The requirement for "6 clear days" means the notice must be received by the police by the Sunday before a Saturday march, excluding both the day of delivery and the day of the event from the count. Therefore, option D is incorrect

Option A is incorrect because the law does not operate on a permit or licensing system where police approval is required. The notice is informational, not a request for permission. The police's power lies in imposing conditions or, in extreme cases, seeking a prohibition order, not in granting or denying permission for the march to take place.

Option C is incorrect as it describes a scenario with no advance notice, which would render the procession unlawful from the moment it begins. While the senior officer can impose conditions on the day, the initial failure to provide advance notice is itself a criminal offence for the organiser.

Option E is incorrect because the statutory duty is to notify the police directly via written notice delivered to a police station. Public advertisement, while possibly good practice, does not fulfil the specific legal obligation set out in the Public Order Act 1986.

Question 67 (LEGAL SYSTEM)

Mr James Scot, a trainee solicitor is reviewing a copy of the Human Rights Act 1998 and sees the following text at the very top of the first page:
"Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—"
Which structural part of the Act of Parliament is represented by this text?
A.The Long Title 
B.The Preamble 
C.The Enacting Formula 
D.The Short Title 
E.The Commencement Provision
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. The Enacting Formula is the formal legal statement that establishes the authority of the Act. It follows the Long Title and precedes the main sections of the Act. In the UK, it acknowledges the role of the Monarch and the two Houses of Parliament. 
Option A is incorrect. The Long Title is a descriptive paragraph explaining what the Act is for (e.g., "An Act to give further effect to rights..."). 
Option B is incorrect. While similar in tone, a Preamble is an introductory statement of intent; the specific wording provided here is the standard "formula" used to give the Act legal force. 
Option D is incorrect. The Short Title is simply the name of the Act (e.g., Human Rights Act 1998).
Option E is incorrect. The Commencement provision specifies when the Act comes into force and is usually found at the end of the Act.


Question 68 (LEGAL SYSTEM)
Micheal Johnson, a solicitor is researching the Human Rights Act 1998 to determine the exact wording of Article 6 (Right to a Fair Trial). The solicitor looks at the main body of the Act but cannot find the full text of the Article in sections 1 through 22.
In which part of the Act is the solicitor most likely to find the full text of the Convention Rights?
A.The Long Title
B. The Interpretation Section 
C.The Preamble 
D.The Schedules
E. The Enacting Formula
The correct option is D.


Explanation
Option D is correct. In the UK legislative drafting style, the main "sections" of an Act (the body) contain the operative legal rules, while the detailed lists or external texts (like the Articles of the ECHR) are placed in the Schedules at the end. For the HRA 1998, the Articles are listed in Schedule 1.
Option A is incorrect. The Long Title only summarizes the purpose of the Act. Option B is incorrect. The Interpretation section defines specific words (like the definition of a "public authority" in s.6). 
Option C is incorrect. Modern UK Acts rarely use Preambles; the Long Title serves this purpose. 
Option E is incorrect. The Enacting Formula is just the formal statement of authority.

Question 69 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

"Stellar Software Ltd" has developed a highly valuable and proprietary data analysis program. Eleanor, the CEO, has discovered that a former senior programmer, Mr. Granger, who left the company last month, has allegedly stolen the core source code. A current employee has secretly informed Eleanor that Mr. Granger is planning to sell the code to a competitor and has been bragging about having encrypted copies on his personal laptop and an external hard drive. 

The informant fears that if Mr. Granger becomes aware that legal action is imminent, he will immediately delete the files or destroy the hardware. Stellar Software Ltd wishes to recover the source code and obtain evidence of the theft. 

Which of the following court orders would be the most appropriate and powerful tool to achieve this objective in these circumstances?

A. Applying for a freezing injunction 
B. Applying for an interim injunction to prevent Mr. Granger from using or disclosing the confidential information.
C. Applying without notice for a search order 
D. Applying for an order for pre-action disclosure 
E. Applying for default judgment 

The correct answer is C.
Explanation
C is correct because a search order is the specific remedy designed to permit entry onto a respondent's premises to search for and preserve evidence which is at a real risk of being destroyed or hidden. The scenario clearly indicates a risk of destruction (deletion of files) and the need for surprise, which are the hallmarks of a search order application.
A is incorrect because a freezing injunction deals with assets, not with the preservation of evidence. While the source code is an asset, the immediate need is to secure the evidence of its theft and prevent its deletion, not to freeze bank accounts. A freezing injunction would not authorise entry and seizure.
B is incorrect because an interim injunction  does not itself secure the physical evidence. An injunction is a prohibitory order, but it does not provide a mechanism to seize the stolen code from Mr. Granger's possession, and it would likely tip him off, leading to the destruction of the evidence.
D is incorrect because pre-action disclosure is a process for obtaining documents through a formal request, not through a surprise search. If Mr. Granger were tipped off by such an application, he would likely destroy the evidence, defeating the entire purpose.
E is incorrect and procedurally nonsensical as no claim has been issued, so there is nothing for Mr. Granger to defend and no possibility of obtaining a default judgment.

Question 70 (LEGAL SERVICES)

David wishes to bring a personal injury claim after a serious road traffic accident. He has a strong case but limited savings. His solicitor proposes a Conditional Fee Agreement (CFA) with a 50% success fee. The claim is ultimately settled for £100,000 in damages.
What is the maximum total amount David can be required to pay his solicitor from these damages under the current CFA regulations?
A. £50,000 
B. £100,000 
C. £25,000 
D. £0, as the other side will pay all his costs.
E. The solicitor's base costs plus disbursements, but no success fee, as it is no longer recoverable from the losing party.
The correct option is C.
Explanation:
Option C is correct. For personal injury claims (with some exceptions like mesothelioma), success fees under a CFA are no longer recoverable from the losing party under LASPO 2012. Any success fee must now be paid by the client out of their damages, but it is subject to a statutory cap. The cap is 25% of the damages awarded for pain, suffering, and loss of amenity (general damages), and past financial losses. For a £100,000 settlement, the maximum success fee deduction would be £25,000.
Option A is incorrect. Although the agreement mentions 50%, this is the percentage uplift on the solicitor's base fees, not a direct percentage of damages. Furthermore, any success fee taken from damages is subject to the statutory 25% cap, rendering a 50% of damages charge unlawful.
Option B is incorrect. A solicitor cannot take 100% of damages; this would be an unenforceable penalty and is prohibited by the CFA Regulations and the statutory cap.
Option D is incorrect. While the other side will usually pay the claimant's base costs and disbursements if they lose, the claimant remains responsible for their own solicitor's success fee under the post-LASPO regime.
Option E is incorrect. The statement about the success fee no longer being recoverable from the losing party is true. However, the success fee can still be charged to the client, subject to the 25% cap. The client therefore pays base costs (if not recovered from the opponent) and a potential success fee from damages.

Question 71 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)
James, a former project manager at "Northern Engineering Ltd," is suspected of stealing confidential technical files before resigning. The company has evidence he downloaded the data and Mary, his former personal assistant has revealed that he plans to delete it from his personal laptop before starting a job with a competitor. The company fears he will destroy the evidence if tipped off.
What is the most appropriate urgent application to secure the evidence?
A. Apply for an interim injunction to prevent data use or deletion.
B. Apply for an order for pre-action disclosure against James.
C. Apply without notice for a search order to enter premises and seize evidence.
D. Apply for a freezing injunction over his assets.
E. Apply for summary judgment for breach of confidence.
The correct option is C.
Explanation
Option C is correct. A search order (formerly an Anton Piller order) is the only remedy that permits the applicant’s representatives to enter a defendant’s premises without notice to search for, preserve, and copy evidence that is at a real risk of being destroyed or concealed. The scenario clearly indicates a high risk of evidence destruction, justifying this draconian measure to prevent irrevocable harm.
Option A is incorrect. An injunction is prohibitory but does not allow for seizure of evidence; serving it would likely prompt the destruction it seeks to prevent.
Option B is incorrect. A pre-action disclosure order would alert James, giving him time to destroy the evidence.
Option D is incorrect. A freezing injunction preserves assets, not physical or digital evidence.
Option E is incorrect. Summary judgment decides the claim but does not address the urgent need to preserve evidence.
Question 72 (LEGAL SERVICES)

Liam and Emma are first-time buyers, purchasing a new-build flat. Eager to save money, they consider using an online "property paperwork service" called "QuickDeed," which is not staffed by solicitors or licensed conveyancers. The service offers to "handle all the legal paperwork" for a fixed fee that is half the price of a local law firm. Their specific service includes checking the developer's title, drafting the transfer deed , corresponding with the developer's solicitor, and submitting the final application to the Land Registry to register them as the new proprietors. They assure that they are is "just as good" as using a solicitor. 

The marketing material uses legal-sounding terminology like "property law specialists" and "guaranteed compliance." They are unaware that the individual managing their transaction has no legal qualifications and previously worked in an unrelated sales role. The service does not have professional indemnity insurance covering legal advice. 

Which of the following best describes the legal status of the "QuickDeed" service's proposed activities?

A. The service is permissible as it simply involves administrative form-filling and does not constitute legal advice.
B. The service is engaging in reserved instrument activities, which it is not authorised to perform.
C. The service is conducting litigation by managing a transactional process between two parties.
D. The service is exercising a right of audience by representing the clients in dealings with the Land Registry.
E. The service is permissible provided it discloses to the clients that it is not a regulated law firm.

B is the correct option 
Explanation
B is the correct option. "Reserved instrument activities" are defined in the Legal Services Act 2007 and primarily encompass the work of conveyancing, including preparing the transfer deed and dealing with the Land Registry. By offering to perform these tasks for a fee, "QuickDeed" is undertaking a reserved legal activity without authorisation, which is a criminal offence.
A is incorrect. The activities described go far beyond simple form-filling. Checking title and drafting the TR1 are tasks requiring legal knowledge and judgment, and they form the core of the reserved activity.
C is incorrect. "Conducting litigation" relates to managing a case through a court or tribunal for a dispute. A non-contentious property transaction, even with negotiations, is not litigation.
D is incorrect. A right of audience involves personally addressing a court or tribunal. Correspondence and written applications to the Land Registry are not considered exercising a right of audience.
E is incorrect. Disclosure of an unauthorised status does not absolve a person or entity from the criminal offence of undertaking a reserved legal activity. The prohibition in the Legal Services Act 2007 is absolute.

Question 73 (LEGAL SYSTEM)

A complex commercial dispute arises between two international companies regarding a sophisticated financial derivatives contract. The case involves allegations of misrepresentation, breach of contract, and disputed interpretations of international banking regulations. The contract value exceeds £5 million and involves expert evidence from financial analysts and international banking law specialists. 
Separately, a family seeks judicial review of a local authority's decision to place their child in care, arguing the decision violated their Article 8 rights to family life and was procedurally unfair. Both cases are to be heard in the High Court. The claimants in each case seek advice about which Division of the High Court will hear their respective cases and what level of judicial expertise they can expect.

Which Divisions of the High Court will hear these respective cases?

A. Both cases will be heard in the King's Bench Division because it has residual jurisdiction over all High Court matters.
B. The commercial dispute will be heard in the Chancery Division and the judicial review in the King's Bench Division.
C. The commercial dispute will be heard in the Commercial Court within the King's Bench Division and the judicial review in the Administrative Court within the King's Bench Division.
D. Both cases will be heard in the Chancery Division because they both involve complex legal and financial matters.
E. The commercial dispute will be heard in the Commercial Court and the judicial review must be heard in the Family Division because it involves a child.

The correct option is C.
Explanation:
Option C is correct because it properly identifies the specialist courts within the King's Bench Division structure. The King's Bench Division contains several specialist courts designed to handle particular types of complex litigation. The Commercial Court is a specialist court within the King's Bench Division that handles complex business disputes including banking, insurance, and international trade matters. Judges sitting in the Commercial Court are specialists in commercial law.

 The Administrative Court, also within the King's Bench Division, hears judicial review claims challenging decisions of public bodies. Here, the derivatives contract dispute is precisely the type of complex commercial matter the Commercial Court was designed to handle, whilst the judicial review of the care decision falls squarely within the Administrative Court's jurisdiction. Both cases benefit from specialist judicial expertise appropriate to their subject matter.

Option A is incorrect because, whilst the King's Bench Division does have residual jurisdiction, it contains specialist courts that hear specific types of cases. Cases falling within specialist court jurisdictions are heard by those specialist courts, not in the general King's Bench Division.

Option B is incorrect because complex commercial disputes, particularly those involving banking and financial instruments, are typically heard in the Commercial Court within the King's Bench Division, not the Chancery Division. The Chancery Division focuses on matters like trusts, estates, company law, and intellectual property.

Option D is incorrect because the Chancery Division does not hear judicial review claims or typical commercial disputes. Its jurisdiction is more specialized to equity, property, trusts, and certain business matters like insolvency and company disputes.

Option E is incorrect because judicial review claims are heard in the Administrative Court within the King's Bench Division, not the Family Division. Whilst the case involves a child, it is fundamentally a public law challenge to a local authority decision, not a private family law matter.


Question 74 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

Three lay magistrates sit to hear a trial in the Magistrates' Court for a defendant charged with theft of goods valued at £600 from a shop. During the trial, the magistrates hear evidence from the shop manager, CCTV footage, and the defendant's testimony. After the evidence concludes, the magistrates retire to consider their verdict. During deliberations, one magistrate argues strongly for conviction, stating "people like this are always guilty and I don't believe a word of the defendant's evidence." A second magistrate is uncertain and expresses doubt about whether the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. The third magistrate tends toward acquittal, believing the CCTV evidence is ambiguous. . After two hours of deliberation, the magistrates remain divided. The first magistrate insists that as the most experienced magistrate with fifteen years' service, his view should prevail. The legal adviser is asked to resolve the deadlock.

How should the magistrates reach their verdict?

A. The most experienced magistrate's view should prevail because experience determines seniority in magistrates' benches.
B. The magistrates must reach a majority decision
C. The legal adviser should decide the verdict because the magistrates cannot agree and the legally qualified clerk has superior knowledge.
D. The magistrates must reach a unanimous decision.
E. The magistrates should convict because the burden is on the defendant to prove innocence if magistrates are in doubt.

The correct option is B.
Explanation:

Option B is correct because magistrates sitting as a bench of three operate on majority decision-making. Where magistrates cannot reach unanimity, a decision supported by two of the three magistrates becomes the verdict of the court. Here, if two magistrates agree on either conviction or acquittal, that is the court's decision even if the third magistrate dissents. This system recognizes that requiring unanimity among lay decision-makers could result in frequent deadlocks and retrials. The majority principle allows magistrates' courts to function efficiently whilst still providing collective decision-making. The experience level of individual magistrates does not create a hierarchy; each magistrate's vote is equal.

Option A is incorrect because magistrates' courts do not operate on a seniority or hierarchy basis. Each of the three magistrates has an equal vote regardless of their length of service or experience. Experience does not give one magistrate's view more weight than another's.

Option C is incorrect because the legal adviser (clerk) does not decide the verdict or facts. The clerk's role is strictly limited to advising on law, procedure, and practice. The decision on guilt or innocence is solely for the magistrates as the tribunal of fact.

Option D is incorrect because unanimity is not required in magistrates' courts. Unlike Crown Court juries, which must seek unanimity (though can later accept majority verdicts), magistrates operate on simple majority decision-making from the outset.

Option E is incorrect because it fundamentally misstates the burden of proof. In criminal cases, the burden is always on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The defendant is never required to prove innocence. If magistrates have doubt, they must acquit.

Question 75 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)

John applies for a Circuit Judge vacancy and the Judicial Appointments Commission shortlists him after testing his case analysis, interviewing him, and reviewing references, while the panel notes that he lacks some leadership indicators that the published criteria treat as essential, but nevertheless ranks him marginally highest on legal competence; when the Commission submits its recommendation to the Lord Chancellor.
 
The Lord Chancellor expresses concern that the JAC has misapplied the statutory merit requirement by favouring technical ability over the full competency framework; the Lord Chancellor issues a notification requesting reconsideration and invites the Commission to justify its interpretation; the JAC replies that it stands by its assessment and reaffirms John as the preferred candidate. John wants to know whether the Lord Chancellor may reject the recommendation at this stage. 

What is the correct legal position?

A. The Lord Chancellor may reject the recommendation a second time without giving reasons.

B. The Lord Chancellor may reject the recommendation only once, following which he must either accept it or appoint no one.

C. The Lord Chancellor may reject the recommendation at this stage provided he gives reasons.
D. The Lord Chancellor may substitute his preferred candidate if the JAC refuses to reconsider.

E. The Lord Chancellor must appoint John because a refusal to reconsider bars any rejection.

The correct option is C.
Explanation
C is correct. Under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the Lord Chancellor may accept, reject once, or request reconsideration once; if he has only requested reconsideration so far, he may still reject with reasons but may not appoint another candidate, preserving the JAC’s merit-based process.

A is incorrect. A second rejection is not permitted; only one rejection and one reconsideration request exist in the statutory sequence.

B is incorrect. The Lord Chancellor is not barred from rejecting at this stage if he has not yet exercised his single rejection power.

D is incorrect. Substituting the Lord Chancellor’s preferred candidate contradicts the statutory framework and would undermine independent appointments.

E is incorrect. A refusal to reconsider does not compel appointment; it merely limits the Lord Chancellor to accepting or rejecting the single recommended candidate.

Question 76 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)

Mary, a High Court judge, issues a judgment criticising an executive department for procedural unlawfulness, and the minister publicly declares that Mary has “overstepped her role”, while making comments that her continued appointment requires “review”; internal government emails later indicate a desire to persuade Mary to resign by proposing a restructuring bill that would significantly reduce her salary, which civil servants warn would breach entrenched guarantees.

Mary receives informal suggestions from senior civil servants that she should voluntarily step down to avoid contentious parliamentary debate; simultaneously, the media describes her as “politically motivated”, adding to pressure on her judicial impartiality; Mary asks for advice regarding whether the executive has any lawful method of removing her based on disapproval of her reasoning.

What is the correct legal position?

A. A High Court judge may be removed by the Lord Chancellor if politically controversial.
B. A High Court judge may be removed only following an address of both Houses of Parliament.
C. A High Court judge may be dismissed by ministerial decision but salary protection remains intact.
D. Cabinet disapproval allows the Prime Minister to suspend the judge pending inquiry.
E. The minister may reduce the judge’s salary to compel resignation.

The correct option is B.
Explanation
B is correct. Security of tenure for senior judges means they may be removed only by an address of both Houses of Parliament, and their remuneration is protected, ensuring decisions remain free from executive pressure; this principle underpins judicial independence.
A is incorrect. Executive displeasure is not a ground for dismissal; unilateral removal is constitutionally barred.
C is incorrect. Ministers have no power to dismiss senior judges and cannot threaten salary adjustments to exert influence.
D is incorrect. The Prime Minister has no suspension power over senior judges for their judicial reasoning.
E is incorrect. Judicial salaries are protected to prevent precisely such coercive tactics.


Question 77 (BUSINESS LAW)

Leo and Ava operate a successful graphic design business as an ordinary partnership under the name "Creative Pulse." Leo, without Ava's knowledge, enters into a contract with a major client, "Brandon Ltd," for a large project, signing the contract "Leo on behalf of Creative Pulse." Leo uses the upfront payment from Brandon Ltd to cover personal gambling debts. When Leo fails to deliver any work, Brandon Ltd sues both Leo and Ava for breach of contract.

Is Ava liable to Brandon Ltd for the breach?
A. No, because Leo acted outside his implied authority and for a fraudulent purpose.
B. Yes, because Leo was acting in the ordinary course of the firm's business.
C. No, because Ava did not consent to or have knowledge of the contract.
D. Yes, but only to the extent of her capital contribution to the partnership.
E. No, because the firm is not a legal person and cannot be sued.

Explanation
Option B is correct. Under the Partnership Act 1890, s.5, every partner is an agent of the firm and the other partners for the purpose of the business of the partnership. The firm is bound by any act of a partner carrying on business in the usual way, even if the partner has no actual authority, unless the third party knows the partner has no authority or does not know the person is a partner. Here, entering into design contracts is clearly within the ordinary business of Creative Pulse. Brandon Ltd was unaware of Leo's lack of authority or his fraudulent intent. Therefore, the firm (and thus Ava as a partner) is bound and liable for the breach.
Option A is incorrect. Lack of authority and fraudulent purpose are not defences against a third party acting in good faith.
Option C is incorrect. A partner's lack of knowledge or consent does not negate liability for acts within the usual course of business.
Option D is incorrect. Partners are jointly and severally liable for partnership debts; liability is not limited to capital contributions.
Option E is incorrect. While a partnership is not a separate legal person, it can be sued in the firm's name, and partners are liable.

Question 78 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)

In a claim for £90,000 for professional negligence, the defendant applies for summary judgment under CPR Part 24. The defendant argues the claim has no real prospect of success because a key element of the duty of care cannot be established. The claimant's solicitor files witness evidence in opposition, stating that expert evidence on the standard of care will be obtained before trial and is likely to support the claim.

How should the court approach the application for summary judgment?

A.  Consider whether the claimant has a some prospect of success.
B. Dismiss the application, because the claimant has a right to obtain expert evidence for trial.
C. Adjourn the application to allow the claimant to file the promised expert report.
D. Consider whether the claimant has a realistic prospect of success.
E. Strike out the claim instead, as it discloses no reasonable grounds.

Explanation

Option D is correct. The test for summary judgment under CPR 24.2 is whether the claimant has a "real prospect" of succeeding on the claim. A "real prospect" means a realistic, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect. The court will not conduct a mini-trial but will assess the evidence available and that which can reasonably be expected at trial. The mere assertion that evidence will be obtained is often insufficient if there is no credible basis for it. The court must decide if, on the material before it, the claim is realistically arguable. Therefore A is incorrect.
Option B is incorrect. The right to obtain evidence does not automatically defeat a summary judgment application if the claim lacks a real prospect.
Option C is incorrect. The court has a discretion to adjourn but is not obliged to do so, especially if the claimant's assertion is speculative.
Option E is incorrect. Strike-out (CPR 3.4) is for claims with no legal basis; here, there is a basis, but its strength is questioned.

Question 79 (CONTRACT)

Elijah contracts to sell a rare, signed first edition book to Sofia for £10,000, with delivery in two weeks. Three days before the delivery date, Elijah emails Sofia: "I've had a better offer. I will not be delivering the book to you." Sofia immediately replies: "I require you to honour our contract." The next day, Elijah changes his mind and emails: "Ignore my previous email. I will deliver as agreed." Sofia does not respond. On the delivery date, Elijah tenders the book, but Sofia refuses to accept or pay for it.

Is Sofia entitled to refuse performance and treat the contract as at an end?

A.No, because Elijah retracted his renunciation before the delivery date.
B. Yes, because Elijah's clear renunciation gave her an immediate right to terminate.
C. No, because she affirmed the contract by demanding performance.
D. Yes, but only if she had communicated her acceptance of the repudiation before the retraction.
E. No, because the retraction rendered the anticipatory breach ineffective.


Explanation
Option B is correct. An unequivocal renunciation of a contract (anticipatory breach) gives the innocent party an immediate right to elect to terminate and claim damages. The right arises upon communication of the renunciation. The innocent party must then make their election. Here, Elijah's first email was a clear renunciation. While Sofia's initial reply demanded performance (which could be affirmation), the law allows a reasonable time for the innocent party to make their final election. Elijah's retraction the next day was ineffective because Sofia had not yet affirmed; she was still within her reasonable election period. Therefore, she could elect to terminate by the delivery date.
Option A is incorrect. A retraction of repudiation is only effective if accepted by the innocent party or if the innocent party has not yet changed their position.
Option C is incorrect. Her initial demand was not necessarily final affirmation; she had a reasonable time to decide.
Option D is incorrect. Communication of acceptance of repudiation is not required before the guilty party retracts; the right to terminate arises immediately.
Option E is incorrect. A retraction does not automatically nullify the repudiation; it requires the innocent party's agreement.

Question 80  (BUSINESS LAW )
Chloe is the sole director of "Bloom Ltd," a floristry business. Needing to secure a last-minute order for a large wedding, Chloe enters into a contract on 10th June with a luxury hotel, committing Bloom Ltd to supply £15,000 worth of floral arrangements. The company's articles require board approval for contracts over £10,000, but Chloe signs alone, believing the urgency justified her actions. The board discovers the unauthorised contract on 12th June but takes no formal action. On 20th June, Bloom Ltd accepts and pays for the flowers from its wholesaler. On 25th June, the hotel cancels the wedding. The board now wishes to avoid the contract with the hotel, arguing Chloe lacked authority.
Can the hotel enforce the contract against Bloom Ltd?
A. No, because Chloe's act was outside her actual authority and has not been ratified.
B. Yes, because the board's failure to repudiate the contract upon discovery constitutes implied ratification.
C. No, because the contract was beyond the financial limit in the articles.
D. Yes, because Chloe had apparent authority as the sole director.
E. No, because ratification must be by shareholder resolution, not board approval.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under common law and the Companies Act 2006, an act by a director that exceeds their authority can be ratified by the company. Ratification can be express or implied from conduct. Here, the board (the appropriate organ) became aware of the unauthorised act on 12th June. By taking no action to repudiate it, and particularly by performing part of the contract on 20th June (accepting and paying for the flowers), the company's conduct clearly indicates an intention to adopt the contract. This constitutes implied ratification, making the contract binding on the company from the outset.
Option A is incorrect. The lack of initial authority is cured by the subsequent ratification through the company's conduct.
Option C is incorrect. Internal limits on authority do not automatically invalidate contracts with third parties, especially if ratified.
Option D is incorrect. While apparent authority might be argued, the clearer legal route here is ratification based on the company's post-discovery conduct.
Option E is incorrect. Ratification of a director's act can typically be done by the board if it is within their powers, which this commercial contract would be.

Question 81 (LEGAL SYSTEM)

Parliament passes the "Public Nuisance (Prevention) Act 2024" to combat the problem of noisy street parties that disturb local residents. Section 1 makes it an offence to "hold or participate in a gathering in a public street which causes excessive noise after 9pm." During a peaceful, silent nighttime vigil in a street to protest a local issue, police arrest the organiser, Isaac, because the gathering, though silent, is causing an obstruction and anxiety to some residents. Isaac is charged under the Act.

If Isaac's lawyer argues the Act does not apply, which rule of interpretation would most assist in focusing the court on the problem Parliament intended to solve?

A. The Literal Rule.
B. The Golden Rule.
C. The Mischief Rule.
D. The Purposive Approach.
E. The Ejusdem Generis rule.

Explanation
Option C is correct. The Mischief Rule (Heydon's Case) directs the court to consider: (1) what the law was before the Act, (2) what mischief the Act was designed to remedy, and (3) what remedy Parliament intended. Here, the mischief was "noisy street parties," not peaceful, silent gatherings causing other forms of nuisance. The Mischief Rule would help limit the application of the statute to the specific problem it was passed to address, potentially excluding Isaac's silent vigil.
Option A is incorrect. The Literal Rule would take the words at face value; "gathering" could literally include a silent vigil.
Option B is incorrect. The Golden Rule is used to avoid an absurd result from a literal interpretation, but the focus is not primarily on the underlying mischief.
Option D is incorrect. The Purposive Approach is a broader, modern technique often used in EU/HR contexts, but the traditional tool for examining the "mischief" is the Mischief Rule.
Option E is incorrect. Ejusdem generis is a linguistic canon for interpreting lists of words, not for identifying legislative purpose.

Question 82 (PROFESSIONAL ETHICS)
Naomi, a solicitor sends a client, Daniel, a bill for £15,000 in respect of completed litigation. Daniel is unhappy, believing the work did not justify the fee. He emails Naomi a detailed list of complaints about the bill and the service received. Naomi’s firm has a Complaints Handling Procedure in place.

What is Naomi’s immediate professional obligation under the SRA Code of Conduct?
A. To inform Daniel that if he disputes the bill, he should apply for a detailed assessment by the court.
B. To treat the email as a formal complaint and initiate the firm’s complaints procedure.
C. To offer a without prejudice meeting to negotiate a reduction in the bill.
D. To report the potential complaint to the Legal Ombudsman within 8 weeks.
E. To send Daniel a copy of the firm’s complaints procedure and await further contact.

Explanation
Option B is correct. Paragraph 8.2 of the SRA Code of Conduct requires that complaints are dealt with promptly, fairly, and effectively in accordance with the firm’s procedure. A clear expression of dissatisfaction about a bill and the service is a complaint that triggers the firm’s obligation to handle it through its formal procedure. The solicitor must acknowledge the complaint and begin the process, which includes investigating, responding, and, if unresolved, informing the client of their right to take the complaint to the Legal Ombudsman.
Option A is incorrect. While detailed assessment is a client’s right, the solicitor must first address the complaint through the mandatory internal procedure.
Option C is incorrect. This may be part of resolving the complaint, but the first step is to formally acknowledge and handle it as a complaint.
Option D is incorrect. Reporting to the LeO is the client’s right, not the solicitor’s initial duty. The firm must handle the complaint first.
Option E is incorrect. Simply sending the procedure is passive and does not constitute initiating the handling of the specific complaint.


Question 83 (CONTRACT)
A small printing business, "QuickPrint Ltd," enters into a standard-form contract with a large paper supplier, "MegaSupply plc," for a regular monthly order. The contract, drafted by MegaSupply, contains a clause stating: "The supplier's liability for any loss or damage, however caused, shall not exceed the price of the goods in respect of which the claim is made." QuickPrint's manager signs without reading the detailed terms. A batch of paper is contaminated with a chemical that ruins QuickPrint's printing presses, causing £50,000 in damage. The price of the batch was £500.
Under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, what is the key test for the validity of this clause against QuickPrint?
A. Whether the clause was reasonable, having regard to the circumstances at the time the contract was made.
B. Whether the clause was fair to a reasonable man.
C. Whether QuickPrint received independent legal advice on the clause.
D. Whether the clause attempts to exclude liability for negligence causing physical damage.
E. Whether the parties were of unequal bargaining power.
Explanation
Option A is correct. UCTA 1977, s.11 and Schedule 2, apply to clauses that seek to limit business liability (as opposed to excluding it entirely for negligence causing death/personal injury, which is void). For a limitation clause between businesses (as here), the test is one of reasonableness. The clause must have been "a fair and reasonable one to be included having regard to the circumstances which were, or ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made." The court will consider factors like bargaining strength, opportunity to contract elsewhere, and whether the customer knew or ought to have known of the term. The disparity between the potential loss (£50k) and the limit (£500) is a strong indicator of potential unreasonableness.
Option B is incorrect. The reasonable man test does not apply here
Option C is incorrect. Lack of independent advice is a factor in assessing reasonableness but is not the key statutory test.
Option D is incorrect. The clause limits, rather than excludes, liability. A complete exclusion for negligence causing physical damage to property would be subject to a reasonableness test (s.2(2)), not automatically void.
Option E is incorrect. Unequal bargaining power is a relevant factor under Schedule 2 in assessing reasonableness, but it is not the standalone legal test.
Question 84 (LEGAL SERVICES)
Sophie, a solicitor, is instructed by a new client, Mr. Ali, who is not personally known to the firm. Mr. Ali wishes to set up a UK private limited company to import electronic goods. He will be the sole shareholder and director. He provides a copy of his passport and a recent utility bill. He states that the company’s start-up capital of £200,000 will come from a business loan from a bank in his home country, but he cannot provide the loan agreement yet as it is being finalised. He is eager to proceed with incorporation immediately.
What is Sophie’s best course of action?
A. Proceed with the incorporation, as the source of funds is a reputable bank and the amount is not suspiciously high.
B. Postpone incorporation until Mr. Ali provides the loan agreement and she can verify the source of the funds.
C. File a suspicious activity report (SAR) with the National Crime Agency due to the lack of documentation.
D. Accept the instructions but apply simplified due diligence because Mr. Ali is a private individual.
E. Proceed but apply enhanced due diligence because the funds are coming from abroad.
Explanation
Option B is correct. The Money Laundering Regulations 2017 require solicitors to conduct customer due diligence (CDD) before establishing a business relationship. CDD includes identifying the customer and verifying their identity (which Sophie has done with passport and utility bill) and identifying the beneficial owner. Crucially, it also includes obtaining information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship and, where necessary, verifying the source of funds. Here, the source is a significant sum from a foreign bank loan. Sophie must take risk-based measures to verify this source; proceeding without seeing the loan agreement would be failing to conduct adequate due diligence. Option A is incorrect as it ignores the need to verify the source. Option C is premature; there is no clear suspicion of money laundering yet, just a lack of evidence. Option D is wrong; simplified due diligence applies only in low-risk situations, which this is not due to the cross-border element and sizeable funds. Option E is partially correct but does not address the immediate need to verify the source before proceeding; enhanced due diligence would be required, which includes obtaining additional information on the source of funds, so postponement is necessary.
Question 85 (CONTRACT LAW )
Lydia contracts to sell a unique, one-of-a-kind sculpture by a famous local artist to Ben for £50,000. Before completion, a gallery offers Lydia £80,000 for the sculpture. Lydia refuses to complete the sale to Ben. Ben has already sold his previous sculpture to make space for this one. Ben sues, seeking an order of specific performance.
Which factor is most critical to the court’s decision to grant specific performance?
A. Whether Ben has suffered loss
B. Whether damages would be an adequate remedy.
C. Whether Lydia acted in bad faith by accepting a higher offer.
D. Whether the court can adequately supervise the execution of the order.
E. Whether Ben has clean hands and came to court without delay.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Specific performance is a discretionary equitable remedy granted only where common law damages are inadequate. The uniqueness of the subject matter is a classic reason for inadequacy. A one-of-a-kind piece of art is considered unique, meaning its equivalent cannot be purchased on the open market. Therefore, damages (the difference in money) may not adequately compensate Ben, making specific performance appropriate. The court’s analysis starts with the inadequacy of damages. Therefore, A is incorrect. 
Option C is incorrect. Bad faith may influence the court's discretion but is not the primary test.
Option D is incorrect. This is a practical consideration but is not the primary legal test for granting the remedy.
Option E is incorrect. These are equitable maxims that may bar the remedy but are not the central test for its availability.
Question 86 (TORTS)
A care home, "Serenity Care Ltd," employs James as a senior nurse. James is on a 24-hour "sleep-in" shift at the home, where he is permitted to sleep but must be available to assist residents if needed. During the night, a resident, Mr. Jones, becomes agitated. James, in an attempt to restrain Mr. Jones quickly, uses an unauthorised and excessively forceful technique he learned privately, causing Mr. Jones injury. The technique was expressly prohibited by Serenity Care's training and policies. Mr. Jones sues Serenity Care, arguing it is vicariously liable for James's actions.
Applying the close connection test, what is the decisive factor in determining vicarious liability?
A. Whether Liam was acting in the course of his employment at the time of the incident, judged by the nature of his role and the circumstances.
B. Whether Serenity Care authorised or expressly forbade the specific act of negligence.
C. Whether Liam was employed by Serenity Care.
D. Whether there is a sufficient connection between the employment and the tort such that it would be fair and just to hold the employer liable.
E. Whether Liam's actions were so personal in nature as to constitute a frolic of his own.
Explanation
Option A is correct. The modern test for vicarious liability, established in cases like Lister v Hesley Hall and Mohamud v WM Morrison Supermarkets, has two stages: (1) The relationship between the tortfeasor and the defendant must be one of employment or akin to employment. (2) The tort must be so closely connected with the employment that it can fairly and properly be regarded as done in the course of employment. This is assessed by considering the nature of the employment and the circumstances of the wrongdoing. An employee acting in an improper mode of doing an authorised act may still be within the course of employment. Here, James was on duty, dealing with a resident, a core employment task. His unauthorised and negligent method of performing that task is closely connected to his employment. Therefore, Option C is incorrect. 
Option B is incorrect. Express prohibition of an act does not automatically take it outside the course of employment if the act is related to the employee's duties.
Option D is incorrect. While fairness is the policy underpinning the doctrine, the legal test is the "close connection" test, not a standalone 'fair and just' assessment.
Option E is incorrect. A 'frolic' refers to an employee going off on a personal errand entirely unrelated to work. James was engaged in his core duties, albeit negligently.
Question 87 (CONSTITUTIONAL LAW)
During a heated debate in the House of Commons, MP Arthur Standish makes a speech accusing a prominent local businessman, Mr. Croft, of "systematic tax evasion and corrupt dealings with local officials." Mr. Croft sues MP Standish for defamation. MP Standish defends the claim by invoking parliamentary privilege.
What is the most likely outcome of the defamation claim?
A. The claim will proceed to trial to determine if the statements were true or made maliciously.
B. The claim will be struck out, as statements made in proceedings in Parliament are absolutely privileged from suit.
C. The claim will succeed only if Mr. Croft can prove the MP acted with malice.
D. The claim will be stayed pending an investigation by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner.
E. The claim will be struck out, but the Speaker of the House may order the MP to make a formal apology.
The correct option is B.
Explanation:
Option B is correct. Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 provides that “proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.” This confers absolute privilege on statements made in the course of parliamentary proceedings. This privilege is a cornerstone of parliamentary sovereignty and free speech in Parliament. The courts have no jurisdiction to entertain a defamation claim based on such statements, regardless of their truth or the motive of the speaker. The claim would be struck out as an abuse of process.
Option A is incorrect because the privilege is absolute; there is no trial on the merits.
Option C is incorrect as it describes qualified privilege, which applies in other contexts (e.g., job references). Parliamentary proceedings are protected by absolute privilege.
Option D is incorrect. While the MP’s conduct might be subject to parliamentary internal discipline, this does not affect the legal bar on court proceedings. The court does not stay the case for a parallel parliamentary process.
Option E is incorrect. The court’s role is to dismiss the claim, not to order a parliamentary remedy. Any apology would be a matter for Parliament, not a condition imposed by the court.

Question 88 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION) 
A claimant is suing a construction company for professional negligence. Both parties agree that expert evidence is required to determine if the building's foundations were laid according to industry standards. The court directs that a Single Joint Expert (SJE) should be appointed to provide a report.
According to CPR Part 35, which of the following best describes the duty of the SJE in this case?
A.The SJE owes a primary duty of care to the claimant as the party who initiated the litigation. 
B. The SJE’s overriding duty is to the court, and this duty supersedes any obligation to the parties.
C. The SJE must advocate for the party that provides the most detailed set of instructions. 
D.The SJE is prohibited from discussing the case with either party's solicitors once appointed. 
E.The SJE's duty is to reach a compromise halfway between the two parties' positions.
The correct option is B.
Explanation
Option B is correct. Under CPR 35.3, it is the duty of an expert (including an SJE) to help the court on matters within their expertise. This duty is overriding and takes precedence over any obligation to the person from whom the expert has received instructions or by whom they are paid. Option A and C are incorrect. An expert must be independent and objective; they are not an "advocate" for either side. Option D is incorrect. SJEs can (and often must) receive instructions from both parties, though transparency is required. Option E is incorrect. An expert's role is to provide an objective professional opinion, not to broker a settlement or "split the difference."
Question 89 (CONTRACT)
David, a structural engineer, was engaged by a property developer, “UrbanSpace Ltd,” to design the foundations for a new apartment block. David negligently specified inadequate foundations. The error was discovered after the building was completed but before any apartments were sold. No physical damage had occurred, but to make the building safe, UrbanSpace had to undertake £500,000 of underpinning works, causing a nine-month delay and lost sales. UrbanSpace sues David in negligence for the cost of repair and consequential economic losses.
Will UrbanSpace succeed in a claim against David for pure economic loss?
A. Yes, because David assumed responsibility for his design and UrbanSpace relied on him.
B. Yes, because the defect posed a real and imminent risk of physical damage to the building.
C. No, because the loss is pure economic loss and David owed no duty of care in tort for such loss.
D. No, because UrbanSpace should have had the design checked by another engineer before construction.
E. Yes, because the relationship between engineer and client is sufficient to establish a duty.
Explanation
Option C is correct. This scenario falls within the principle established in Murphy v Brentwood District Council: where a defect in a building causes no physical damage to other property, but only requires repair or causes economic loss, there is generally no duty of care in negligence. The loss here is pure economic loss (cost of repair and delay). The exception under Hedley Byrne (assumption of responsibility) might apply if there was a special relationship, but in a standard contractor-client relationship, the law typically confines such claims to contract. Since David was engaged directly by UrbanSpace, they have a contract, and tort duty for pure economic loss is excluded. 
Option A is incorrect as assumption of responsibility is not easily established in such professional services contracts; the contract defines the duties. 
Option B is incorrect; the “imminent risk” argument might allow a claim if there was a real danger, but the loss claimed is still economic. Option D is a factual point but not the legal principle. Option E is too broad.
Question 90 (BUSINESS LAW)
Zara is a non-executive director of "GreenTech Innovations Ltd." The board is considering entering into a substantial contract with "DataFlow Ltd" for cloud services. Zara's husband is the majority shareholder and managing director of DataFlow Ltd. Zara is aware of this connection. At the board meeting where the contract is discussed, Zara remains silent about her connection, votes in favour of the contract, and it is approved. The contract is on arm's-length commercial terms. A minority shareholder later discovers the connection and alleges a breach of directors' duties.
In relation to Zara's failure to declare her interest, which of the following statements is legally accurate under the Companies Act 2006?
A. Zara is in breach of her duty under s.177 to declare the nature and extent of her interest to the board, and the transaction is voidable by the company.
B. Zara is in breach of s.177, but the transaction is not voidable because it was on arm's-length terms and the board would have approved it even if she had declared her interest.
C. Zara is not in breach of s.177 because her interest is as a connected person (spouse) and not a direct interest, and she did not need to declare it.
D. Zara is in breach of s.177, but the transaction may be ratified by the board and until then it remains voidable.
E. Zara is not in breach of s.177 because she remained silent and did not influence the board's decision, and the contract was fair.
Explanation
Option A is correct. Section 177 of the Companies Act 2006 requires a director to declare the nature and extent of any direct or indirect interest in a proposed transaction or arrangement with the company. An interest of a person connected with the director (including a spouse) is treated as an indirect interest of the director (s.252). The declaration must be made before the company enters into the transaction. Failure to declare is a breach of duty. Under s.178, the consequences of a breach of s.177 are that the transaction is voidable by the company (subject to the bars on rescission) and the director is accountable for any gain and must indemnify the company for any loss. The fairness of the transaction or whether the board would have approved it anyway is irrelevant to the breach, though it may affect whether the company chooses to avoid the transaction or claim damages.
Option B is incorrect. While fairness and hypothetical approval may be relevant to whether the company affirms the transaction or claims damages, they do not negate the breach or the voidability of the transaction.
Option C is incorrect. Interests of connected persons are expressly covered and must be declared.
Option D is incorrect. Ratification is a possibility, but it requires a resolution of the members (shareholders), not just the board, and until ratification the transaction remains voidable. However, the statement is not fully accurate because ratification is not the only factor; the breach still occurred.
Option E is incorrect. Silence does not excuse the duty to declare; the duty is proactive. Fairness is not a defence to the breach of the declaration duty.
