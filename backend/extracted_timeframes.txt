Basic Accounting Principles For Solicitors Account
COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTING ENTRIES TABLE
Principle | Explanation | Practical Example
1. Debit the Receiver, Credit the Giver | This is the "Golden Rule" of double-entry. If the bank receives money, you debit the bank. If a client gives you money, you credit their ledger. | You receive a £500 deposit. Debit Cash (Bank) because the bank received it. Credit Client Ledger because the client gave it.
2. Income Balances are Credits | Money that is "yours" (the firm's profit) or money you "owe" (client funds) sits on the Credit side of a ledger. | At the end of a case, you have £1,000 in the client's name. This should show as a Credit on their ledger—representing a debt you owe them.
3. Profit & VAT are Credits | These represent the firm’s earnings. They only move to the Debit side when you actually pay them out (e.g., paying VAT to HMRC). | When you send a bill for £100 + £20 VAT, you Credit Profit Costs (£100) and Credit VAT (£20) to record that income.
4. Identify the "Who" | Before writing anything, ask: "Who is the money moving between?" Is it Client-to-Firm, Firm-to-Third-Party, or Client-to-Client? | Moving a deposit from a buyer to a seller? You Debit the Giver (Buyer) and Credit the Receiver (Seller).
5. The Interest Rule | You cannot keep the interest earned on client money for yourself. It belongs to the client unless you have a written agreement saying otherwise. | If a client’s £100k generates £50 interest in your account, you must Credit that £50 to their ledger.
6. The 5-Week Rule | You must perform a "reconciliation" (matching your books to the bank statement) at least every 5 weeks to catch errors early. | Every month, the COFA (Compliance Officer) checks that the total on the Client Ledgers matches the actual cash in the Client Bank Account.
7. The £250k Threshold | Not every firm needs an expensive accountant's audit. If you hold very little client money, the SRA waives the formal report. | A small firm that never holds more than £10,000 on average does not need to submit a formal Accountant's Report.
8. Petty Cash | This is for "milk and stamps." It’s firm money kept in a physical box for tiny office expenses. | You buy a £2 pack of pens. Debit Stationery Ledger (the receiver of the pens) and Credit Petty Cash (the giver of the money).
