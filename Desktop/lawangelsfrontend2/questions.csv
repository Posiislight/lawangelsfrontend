"A client is purchasing a large, detached property in England for £850,000. The property consists of a main house and a separate, self-contained annexe with its own entrance. The annexe has been rented out to a tenant on a commercial lease for the last five years. The client intends to use the main house as their primary residence but will continue to rent out the annexe. The client's solicitor is advising on the Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) liability. What is the correct basis for calculating the SDLT on this purchase?","Stamp Duty Land Tax","hard","A","The entire purchase price should be treated as residential property, and SDLT calculated using the residential rates and bands.","B","The entire purchase price should be treated as non-residential property, and SDLT calculated using the non-residential rates and bands.","C","A mixed-use appraisal is required, and SDLT must be calculated by apportioning the purchase price between the residential and non-residential elements and applying the respective rates to each portion.","D","The purchase qualifies for multiple dwellings relief, and SDLT should be calculated based on the average value of the two dwellings.","E","As the client will occupy part of the property, the entire purchase qualifies for first-time buyer's relief, provided the client is a first-time buyer.","C","For SDLT purposes, a property is mixed-use if it consists of both residential and non-residential elements. A dwelling that is let on a commercial lease constitutes a non-residential element. The law requires the purchase price to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis, and the residential and non-residential SDLT rates applied to their respective portions, as per the Finance Act 2003. A is incorrect because the presence of a commercially let annexe means the property is not wholly residential. B is incorrect because the main house is a residential dwelling; the property is not wholly non-residential. D is incorrect because Multiple Dwellings Relief applies to the purchase of two or more distinct dwellings, but the commercially let annexe is treated as a non-residential element in this mixed-use scenario, not a separate dwelling for the purpose of this relief. E is incorrect because First-time buyer's relief is only available for entirely residential properties where the purchaser is a first-time buyer and the purchase price is below a specific threshold, which does not apply here."
"A solicitor is acting for a client who is purchasing the freehold of a vacant commercial office building in England from a developer. The developer has notified the client that they have exercised an option to tax the building. The client's business makes only exempt supplies for VAT purposes. The client is concerned about the financial impact of this. What is the effect of the developer's option to tax on this transaction?","Value Added Tax","hard","A","The purchase price will be subject to VAT at 20%, and the client will be unable to recover this VAT as input tax.","B","The purchase price will be subject to VAT at 0%, which the client can disregard.","C","The purchase price will be subject to VAT at 20%, which the client will be able to recover in full as input tax.","D","The option to tax is invalid because the building is vacant, so the sale will be exempt from VAT.","E","The client can require the developer to revoke the option to tax prior to completion to avoid the VAT charge.","A","Where a seller has opted to tax a commercial property, the sale becomes a standard-rated supply, and VAT at 20% is added to the price. A purchaser who makes only exempt supplies (such as certain financial or residential rental services) is not registered for VAT or is partially exempt and cannot recover all input VAT. Consequently, they cannot reclaim the VAT charged on the purchase, making it a real cost. B is incorrect because an option to tax makes the supply standard-rated (20%), not zero-rated. C is incorrect because it assumes the client can recover the input tax, which is false given the client makes only exempt supplies. D is incorrect because the validity of an option to tax is not affected by the property being vacant; it applies to the building itself. E is incorrect because a purchaser cannot compel a seller to revoke an option to tax. Once made, an option to tax generally remains in effect for 20 years."
